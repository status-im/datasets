## The Survey

The Survey was hosted on Google Forms at the URL:
[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjRL9cdeueC322RDK86soBv79VsgLQeGlibUL5PuWrte_-og/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjRL9cdeueC322RDK86soBv79VsgLQeGlibUL5PuWrte_-og/viewform).

Below is a text depiction of the form:

EIP0 Shared Values

If you are reading this, your voice matters to the future guidance of Ethereum. 

The intent behind this survey is to create an open data-set of individual perspectives to help inform 
the Shared Values of Ethereum. Establishing cultural guidelines will help inform new community 
members and serve as our collective compass moving forward into the future.

No question is required, anonymity is optional, so please submit even partial responses, any 
information you can provide is valid. 

Please submit your response before June 1st, so we can present the findings at the next Ethereum 
Bangkok meetup!

For further discussion:

I encourage you to please share this survey with anyone you think can contribute meaningfully.
