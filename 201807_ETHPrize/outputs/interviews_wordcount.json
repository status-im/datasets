NFT standards.\nNeufund was largest Solidity project before \u2013\u2013 tokenized equity.\nYou want a EuroToken. You don\u2019t want your company valuated in Ether.\nWhat if blockchain forks; which token is actually tied to the company?\nBounty approach gives many different styles within the codebase.\nThis is a problem; e.g. OpenSSL codebase after Masters \/ PhDs.","who_what":"0x - Decentralized exchange protocol. It is a set of smart contracts that handle standard transactions in an order format.\nThe key advantage here is that these smart contracts leads to shared liquidity\nWe also achieve increased security and network liquidity through our architecture.\nWe launched the network in August 2017.\nIt works, but is V1. We are working on V2 which helps people build hybrid stations, supports new token standards, and makes the contract more gas efficient.\nV1 only allows humans to create orders; V2 will allow new smart contract to create orders. This is HUGE.\nNotes:\nWe\u2019re building the protocol; designing the standard; building dev tools for anyone to build a decentralized exchange.\nOrders may become invalid for any reason:\nOrder being filled\nGriefing attacks\nWe\u2019ve now built an OrderWatcher that keeps relayers updated on the state of orders.\nWe\u2019re using contract Events as a proxy for state changes.\nCan do a diff between state trees and between block headers.\nWe also have a set of smart contracts to handle settlement;\nEveryone who wants to trade is setting allowances on a smart contract.\nWe want upgradability.","tooling":"EthereumJS \/ truffle hardwallet provider \/ Typedoc (to generate documentation) \/\nWe don\u2019t use Truffle anymore\nNot reliable \u2013 can have race conditions;\nArtifacts don\u2019t allow you to have versions of the contract on different networks\nYou don\u2019t run into this stuff if you\u2019re just building a \u201chello world\u201d\nOverwriting parts of the contracts;\nWe rolled our own. It\u2019s open-source but not documented. We have other things that are keeping us busy.\nThe problem is that Truffle has too much functionality \u2013\u2013 we would like to see more of a Unix philosophy.\nCannot support different versions of Solidity.\nVersion management doesn\u2019t exist.\nEthPM \u2013\u2013 doesn\u2019t have versioning either? It\u2019s going through a big refactor, so we held off. We need the NPM package manager.\nWe have built a lot of developer tools to interface with the smart contracts ourselves.\nWe have also built own deployer and migration tool, as truffle\u2019s did not suit our needs.","frustrations":"Getting a simple experimental environment up is hard\nRemix is there; but it\u2019s not enough.\nTracing and profiling is not existent.\nRemix does it, but can\u2019t do it locally.\n\u201cCode coverage\u201d tool exists but inserts console.logs in\nAdding up gas costs per line of code.\nNeed to do profiling, because gas costs depend on inputs.\nSolidity language itself:\nCrashed the Solidity compiler twice today.\nE.g. AbiEncoderV2 is pretty new and hard to understand\/use.\nThe code that it produces is inefficient.\nThere is a stark stack limit in solidity\nAll the variables are locally scoped.\nUn-intuitive as it is a curly braced language.\nThe lifecycle hook value_of is within a function.\nCan only access top 16 slack slots.

SafeMath \u2013\u2013 turns every operator into function call \u2013 which is a huge gas sink.\nHow Solidity optimizes could be improved:\nIt focuses on the code size (which makes sense since it\u2019s minimizing the state tree); but sometimes you need to optimize size of tx gas (e.g. 0x needs optimized fillOrder call)\nABI doesn\u2019t implement introspection\nEIP 165\nE.g. \u201cdoes this contract implement ERC20, or ERC223?\u201d\nSolidity should have this in-built.\nShould be built into the API spec and compiler.\nInheritance:\nInterface or abstract contract \u2013 e.g. Solidity automatically creates getters for state functions \u2013\u2013 collides with\nContract which implements an interface \u2013 public or external for abstract functions \u2013 they collide\nERCs \u2013 there is not a formal way to describe the interface for contracts.\nHave a standard repo \u2013\u2013 this will lead to a canonical ABI definition \u2013\u2013 can have semantic rules around this.

testrpc.\nNeufund was different than 0x:\nNeufund was a trustee for tokens \u2013\u2013 it was centralized by definition.\nThis made it simpler: I could create \u201copen-ended\u201d contracts \u2013\u2013 a switch statement, that the default would send to another proxy contract.\nBut wouldn\u2019t be able to do this with 0x \u2013\u2013 e.g. if we wanted to add Shnorr signatures

So we have been working for the last year to build these.\nWe are now switching gears to think about what a network between the orgs will really look like.\nWe build aragon_os: an OS for organizations. We tend to think about resources (i.e. people and money), and structure the OS according to well-known principles. Instead of people and money, normal OSes manage CPU and RAM etc.\nTwo key pieces to this sort of work:\nControlling money.\nControlling permissions.\nWe also provide a lot of UI components on top of the contracts that we are writing.\nThe entire goal of 0.5 (live on Rinkeby now) is to allow people to easily create and manage their own organisation, along with granular permission and financial management.\nShould be able to create their own application to live in their organisations: and this is where we imagine the network of organisations will emerge from.\nHooking up your own apps, and designing your own interfaces to handle certain complex behaviour","tooling":"Four categories:\nEVM and lower level stuff:\nA lot of our problems have been solved by solidity 0.5 pragma\nRevert with reason! Should be better for error logging.\nDynamically-sized parameters inside the EVM. We did not have an opcode before Byzantium that could have handled returndatasize with dynamically-sized stuff.\nWe play a lot with assembly and ABIEncoding has really bugged us before inside Solidity. So when, for eg, we want to stuff dynamic arrays with mock call data sent through delegatecalls. We have to do some funny business to properly encode them, and 0.5 exposes tooling to do this automatically.\nSmart contracts:\nNot a lot of great tools here yet, especially around testing. This seems to be a fairly obvious hole.\nNot a big fan of Truffle, even though everyone seems to use it. It is especially slow when compiling.\nSolc can be installed directly on most distros, and does stuff in less than 1s, whereas solcjs will take 20s, so why would you go for the latter?\nDapphub has their own set of nix-based tools that I haven\u2019t tried yet, and really want to. But the barrier to understanding here if you don\u2019t come from the right programming background is very high.\nWe use a bunch of standard libraries like Open Zeppelin, and the MiniMeToken and some other cool code that tends to fly around on GitHub or Reddit in the right places. However, this is a tricky place right now, because Package Management is unclear and no-one is yet sure if they want to use ETHPM.\nThere is a lot of people copy-paste contracts into their own repos, which isn\u2019t great. It would be better to see them moved between repos with commit hashes and proper referencing.\nWe do this, as it is especially helpful for auditiability.\nDev tooling that allows people to easily build aragon applications:\nIt\u2019s tough to develop Ethereum applications right because there are a lot of things you need to spin up yourself.\nDeploy a local chain, deploy your contracts onto it, and then only with that done can you start building a UI linked to that chain.\nNot too bad if you have just a few contracts, but with the way that Aragon has been designed (esp in term of flexibility) there are a lot of components that need to be deployed on chain before it all begins to work.\nENS on local chain, APM, base logic contracts, factories to extend the proxies on top of those basic contracts, and then only do we have a good chain state for people to hook up a UI against.\nThis produces a lot of friction, both internally and externally, so we have this goal to simplify it all.\nGanache has a snapshotting feature where it will dump the entire chain state (the whole patricia trie into a bunch of JSON files) that can then be used to start up your own chain from that state.\nHowever, when you tell Ganache to run from the snapshot, if you do anything on the chain, it overwrites everything.\nSo you actually need two snapshots and some patience to get things right.\nWe also need to deploy things onto IPFS, which adds another barrier for users wanting to get going with local development.\nSo, we have tried to build this command into aragon-cli, called \u201caragon run\u201d that handles everything for you.\nBased on the brittleness of tooling though, it\u2019s very difficult to make this reliable, and get it to error gracefully and debug why it isn\u2019t working when it fails.\nUI:\nNot too much in terms of Ethereum-related tooling - a lot is just normal, front-end javascript.\nMajor frustration is web3.js. There are just so many things wrong with that package\u2026 \u201cEvery day is new adventure when using web3\u201d.\nPretty much every time we have had to do something for a deadline, we have run into issue with it that have delayed us.\ni.e. in Buenos Aires, we wanted a mainnet launch for our Survey App, for which we need websockets and https.\nWe set Parity up with secure websockets on our own node and launched our UI and web3 just doesn\u2019t connect to secure websockets. So what was the problem?\nTook some hours to play with all the different settings before realising that the latest version of web3 doesn\u2019t support websockets. Downgrading then works, but the previous package didn\u2019t have some other functions we needed.\nRelied on getting events to process changed information in the UI. However, the event handler in one particular version of the package would send some events in the error callback as opposed to the actual one and we were totally baffled how that could even be.","frustrations":"My biggest general frustration comes with the relative youth of the whole industry, which underlies a lot of our collective frustration, including both security and development.\nIt feels like we sometimes have our hands and feet tied when we are trying to make something. When you make a typical web app, there is a lot of freedom in tooling and the tooling is robust.\nYou can make changes easily, watch these changes propagate, feel productive, and get feedback immediately.\nThis is not the case on Ethereum - things that should take a day actually take a week or a month.\nEstimation of time is really difficult, but especially in Ethereum given how many unknown unknown there are.\nIt\u2019s really easy to get started, but it gets harder and harder to maintain.\nNow that we have a lot of stuff built out, we now have to maintain it, and that decreases the rate at which we can ship new features as there is a lot of old architecture you need to deal with.\nFeels like we\u2019re playing a lot more defense than offence. Was first introduced to this by Jon Choi: you should be proactively pursuing offense and limiting defense (i.e. innovation over optimization).\nAll of these tools that are \u201cnot quite robust\u201d tend to waterfall a lot, which means we are consistently on the defense, even against the tools we\u2019re using.\nNo teams are really at the level of engineering that we need to be at. It\u2019s all shooting from the hip right now, which we fall into too because we want to ship things quickly.\nThere are no really great patterns or best practices or frameworks to follow just yet, or at least a shortage of them in the ecosystem.\nEvery year in traditional ecosystems, a new testing framework will come out, which is really great and I would love to see a similar situation beginning to happen in the Ethereum world.","testing":"In addition to the above we also use solidity-coverage, which can be super painful too. Not sure if the most recent version has fixed some of the issues, as we haven\u2019t yet upgraded (we pin our contracts to an older version of solc for security reasons after they have been audited with a specific compiler version).\nAll of the tools are tightly coupled to the solc versions they use, and this becomes an issue in general for updating tools for coverage and testing. This should take 30 mins to set up, and yet, our CI is still broken today because solidity-coverage just does not want to work.","missing_tools":"A nice debugger!

Augur is writing a middleware node to overcome this.\nImpractical to fetch large amounts of data from blockchain - it\u2019s too slow. It takes a minute and half to get data (how do you manage that experience in the UI?). Running a remote geth node - fetching data from logs + contracts is not fast either.

It took significant engineering to put something on testnet (had to 51% attack it to increase block size).\nGetting TestNet eth is hard ---  not a way to get a good amount of rinkeby (can only get a little bit from faucet -- don\u2019t want people spamming it with transactions)\nReally intense test suites running against Ropsten (Raiden\u2026)\nWould be great if we could easily spin up private chain to deal with that.

L4 working on generalizable state channels, excited about that.\nFrom a business standpoint, you want to build on Ethereum. People come to them and say they want to build EOS. Reason Ethereum doesn\u2019t scale is that they\u2019re trying to scale and not make a huge compromise. But there isn\u2019t a lot of marketing.

Optimising the EVM for bespoke needs - could be for clients, for enterprises. Lower level focus.\nCreate tools and mechanisms for people to utilise the tech as easily as possible.\nCollaborating with Aion & Shyft on potential implementation of a bridge.\nBoth on top of parity-bridge, which has some limitations:\nMade only to work with POA.\nData availability for token information, following delegate_calls and not events.\nSuggest work with Jay Rush and maybe add them into the team!!","tooling":"Truffle\nLack of modularity is the biggest problem (across all tools listed below). Building on top of, rather than within, the EVM you need to update the toolset you\u2019re using and this becomes really difficult with the current tools.\nIf you implement some different opcodes in solidity, you need to take them all the way up. Open source is great, but it needs to be easy to fork and re-implement it easily in order for it to be really powerful.\nTalk to person who had to modularise Truffle internally (not just testing, but also the lack of modularity - if you want to change something and still talk to others in the space, the best solution is often to rewrite the whole tool yourself, which is less than ideal). Aidan to send intro to David about this.\nParity and Geth\nAlso speak with David and Greg.\nUse Parity due to responsiveness from the community and how good they are at answering questions!!! Great community - so NB!! Aidan\u2019s biggest asset is his network of core community members, which really matters in decentralized communities - open channels of communication.\nRust is a more obscure language and people lack experience, hence geth is somewhat easier to use and troubleshoot.\nGeth has a bigger community, but the actual people developing the client aren\u2019t as readily available as Parity.\nMetaMask for frontend development\nWere tasked with making MM work for client and had to rebuild a lot of the stuff. Will also send an intro to the dev who handled. Greg is his name.\nMythril\nHuge frustrations with this tool. Getting it running is a pain in the ass.\nIf it could be applied at the stack layer and not the smart contract layer. Build something like Mythril for an EVM implementation, trace things up the stack cleanly, add\/remove opcodes, make new instructions. A stack explorer so to speak.\nCould spawn so many things because we could understand the stack in a better way and grab a lot more logic. Pity to see focus on higher level tools, which has become somewhat of a hindrance. Why hyperledger went out and did it themselves (not just the licensing issues).\nEducational tool for stupid web devs like me to learn about how opcodes actually work and are composed in the EVM.\nRegular rust and node related stuff (also some go stuff).\nAre there tools from these arenas that don\u2019t exist in Ethereum which would be really cool?\nWe need to make these tools more closely aligned with the chain itself. With WASM coming online, this is already happening and we just need to be ready - i.e. teach everyone WASM.\nThe end if here for really high-level development with WASM. What this will mean for the community and internet in general has yet to be discussed completely.\nTry to use ethers.js as much as possible as opposed to web3\nThe person developing these tools (Richard) is totally accessible, responds to issues immediately (faster than a bot!!) - he is so collaborative and wants to make sure everyone is using the best tools possible, and this all makes such a difference.\nPolymath people doing off-chain signing, which you couldn\u2019t do at the time and 1 of the methods didn\u2019t have a response variable they needed, and by the next morning it was updated. Tight feedback loops make it so much better to use tools.\nYou can create your own wallet in 4 LOC in your terminal - again the language and syntax is so much easier for a non-dev that this solution ought to win in the long time. Very relatable and understandable code base.\nGave solidity and parity\/EVM workshops:\nEVM workshop: took instructions, showed how it would be passed onto stack, where things go, how it gets passed on to memory. Questions were so relevant and knowledgeable.\nWhereas in the solidity workshop, the questions were much more absurd and irrelevant. Talking about the stack, people from a dev background get it. It just makes sense. Take away: if we want devs who have been developing for 20 years, we need to actually show them how the stack works.\nThis is a community-wide failure that we need to focus on - for someone with a CompSci degree, solidity is crazy, but the stack is not!!\nBounty for cleaning up the yellow paper. Speak with David about this and his more in-depth version of the yellow paper.\nOnly ever hindered by delivering work because of MetaMask. Event and event monitoring between different networks was a fix that took a long time to be fixed. They have updated since and we haven\u2019t done any more work there since.","frustrations":"","testing":"Talk with Stu, who handles all the testing stuff.\nUsed to do what Mythril does: visualize the contracts as it does now, so once it is set up, it is very cool for us to use.\nSuch a focus on formal verification in Solidity (but who even knows if it really matters?).\nNot doing fuzz testing for instance, and it seems like a lot of these requests are based on assumptions that have not been proven.\nNo-one knows what the optimal testing framework is, so more default templates in general that allow people to use what they need to use across different projects.\nAgain, modularity is what matters most.\nBoth unit and functional test as necessary. Unit testing seems more standard. Mocha and chai within truffle for the most part.\nEthereum-js VM has really bad testing around it and could be really usefully improved. We need some kind of local implementation to do testing on! Write another test suite as a bounty here.","missing_tools":"Mythril for the EVM stack. Rewrite a complete stack visualizer for the whole EVM. Add opcodes to the stack and see how it looks programatically and logically would be awesome.\nEven an overhauled IDE that is actually Integrated. Again, rewritten from scratch with a focus on modularity would be really nice to see. Even just clearing your cache properly and the way it physically looks is not good enough.","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"Two of our most exciting projects:\nShift - decentralized KYC\/AML platform.\nBunz - a hyper-localized bartering solution. Started as FB group, grew to 60 000 users all bartering locally in Toronto. The people weren\u2019t just bartering anymore, but using gift cards, subway tokens, beer bottles, anything that could be converted into transactable good. Crypto can be the main medium. Currently have 200 000 users on the app and website and over 1 000 000 items available.","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"","best_resources":"Honestly just readthedocs, gitter channels and searching through GH issues.\nMoved from slack and gitter, to riot and gitter, and also ethereum stackoverflow.\nIf there is an issue, go to those repos as it is so unlikely that you are the first person to experience an issue using Ethereum tools.\nHardest to learn about the stack and opcodes\nFind the right local communities and get involved with them. Pair programming and being equally confused together is really helpful.","questions_to_ask":"","smart_contract_wordcount":{"topics":{"NFT":0,"audit":0,"blockchain":0,"bounty":0,"client":0,"community":0,"compiler":0,"consensus":0,"contract":0,"decentralized":0,"deployment":0,"documentation":0,"event":0,"gas":0,"governance":0,"hash":0,"network":0,"payment":0,"protocol":0,"signature":0,"solidity":0,"testing":0,"token":0,"transaction":0,"verification":0,"wallet":0},"projects":{"Augur":0,"Bamboo":0,"Casper":0,"Embark":0,"Ethereum":0,"Geth":0,"Gitcoin":0,"Infura":0,"MetaMask":0,"Mythril":0,"Parity":0,"Plasma":0,"Remix":0,"Sharding":0,"State

stuff: interactions between opcodes, JS dev and web3 also comes into this at the other side\nGreg: Reimplementation and adding functionality to the EVM and a lot of \u201cbridge work\u201d\nSetting up bridges, working with parity bridge and other existing contracts\nAdded efficiencies for personal needs to types when blocks are getting written. Basically recreated in the EVM to get a sender.\nWay blocks are written into the merkle tree.\nParity bridge is cumbersome because it is not well versionized and depends on the version of the EVM you are running\/that you forked from. Often requires a ton of extra configuration.\nStu: solidity and PM (managing groups of people working at that layer of the stack), building smart contracts for clients","tooling":"JetBrains suite as an IDE. Remix comes in there for extra convenience but has it faults and is not totally integrated.\nBiggest problem with Remix is that it is written in jQuery and it is monolithic. Don\u2019t know when it compiling\/rebuilding contracts. Spinner doesn\u2019t spin more than once, no responsiveness, very frustrating. Well laid out for an MVP ;)\nPass in data as strings and not having it parsed as strings is frustrating.\nWill meet with Remix team this week to advance development further. Seeing it as only 2 devs hammers home how under-resourced a lot of this software infrastructure is.\nDebugger has not really been touched since the first version. Critical software lagging behind is not good. Still better than the truffle debugger though.\nEVMLab - has an old school debugger that lets you step thru opcodes and examine what is happening in memory and storage. Has not been maintained recently, so you need to hack it together yourself.\nWeb3 and truffle sometimes, but not often. Often Remix and a couple RPC calls with console.log()s suffice.\nLooking over Mithril and visualisation of the control flow seems really interesting. Handles all the low hanging fruit, as an automated system should.","frustrations":"Up to date documentation!!\nSystem dependence stuff would also be great to include (Mac OS\/Windows\/ Linux)\nThing s are fairly minimal, often have to hack together things yourself because the specific functionality you need is not implemented\nWhen doing tests, get very unhelpful errors. Make them more specific! EVM errors in general are garbage.\nTheir error handling, geth specifically, basically used the same error in most cases to propagate it out. Go through subsections of EVM and write proper errors[a].\nAre you going to be using revert with reason in that case?\nCall contract that deploys another contract. If gas is too low, it will just revert with no clear error. Needed to raise the gas, and it took 3 days of trial and error to figure it out (not clear if they will be or not, answer was more general about past problems they have had)\/","testing":"Mostly unit tests in mocha and chai.\nMostly using Travis to automate the pipeline.\nProjects are fairly young and PoC - so not necessarily a major concern at this point.\nIf not already mentioned, are there any libraries you rely on regularly?","missing_tools":"EVMLab certainly has some of the features required, but they are very inaccessible\nDirectly execute arbitrary code and trace through it in nice fashion that is not just some JSON output.\nNeed to be able to step through those traces easily, which is also not possible there currently.\nGo implementation of parity bridge (to make it leaner). Only one bridge that is open source, so having another one would be useful, especially seeing as Parity devs don\u2019t document well, especially changes between versions.\nSome level of standardisation around bridges and agreement about how they should be structured.\nWhat does interoperability actually mean in this context?","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"Greg: Looked at web3 documentation (as it was more web based stuff at first).\nTruffle pet shop worked well for a lot of people\nDavid: Ethereum wiki was starting point, but you HAVE to talk to people about it.\nReinforcement comes through discussion and USE.\nStu: some limited solidity tutorials, go on to gitter and ask questions with code snippets nd other organic community involvement.","excited_about":"","easier_expected":"Community! Going to EDCON was an eye-opening, validating experience. Impostor syndrome is real and the remote work can be very isolating, but you can also own that and it is inspirational to see.\nPerfectly OK to make stuff up as you go.\nAvailability of people, and the amount of people who can and will answer your dumb questions.\nAlso, it\u2019d be awesome to actually put computer science background to

In transpiling process of C++ version, it drops down performance. The JS transpile needs to be improved.\nSolc compiler slows down development time. Ideal to stay in local JS (and not have to go back to solc), have it compiled super fast inline using a tagged template literal or something like it (using require(\u201csolc-inline\u201d) or equivalent).\nCould write `solidity` in backticks and have it compiled all in same file.\nWould make experimentation and testing much easier and faster. Could potentially provide some specs\/API for this. Will provide further specs via email.\nTrying to build complex systems with 20 contracts and everytime need to wait 20 minutes\nTestRPC + Geth Client\nNot well maintained - ask Truffle team.\nPeople are trying to get away from it - people want to test on GETH \/ Parity and use them to run their own Geth nodes, but it\u2019s a pain in the ass.\nWas working on Geth library that allowed you to run in Mac \/ PC with JS\nUsed Geth like Testrpc - allowed you to test contract codes against all clients (Geth \/ RPC \/ Parity)\nNever finished, but definitely needed.\nIf you\u2019re running contract tests locally, TestRPC is only ETH JS VM. This is, however, not the VM most of miners are using, and that can be cause for concern.\nCan we make testing contracts against Geth easier? NodeJS Wrapper against Geth (most people are using Truffle - would be happy if Truffle had a module for this)\nTruffle uses Ganache which is ETH JS VM - this isn\u2019t used in production.\nTruffle involves hassle of having to download run and configure GETH\nMaybe a wrapper or easy install script - run Geth like TestRPC","frustrations":"Data verifiability problem - nobody is going to another source of data\nRun your own local system and test whatever is run by Infura vs. your system -- should be able to test this against your own local Dapp\nNot a lot of utility to compare -- would be great to have library and testing script\nProtection mechanism to keep an eye on infura -- ecosystem driven thinking to reduce amount of trust to test what they are giving us\nExchanges should be running internal nodes to make sure getting the right data - need something to compare their node to Infura\nBuild a Dual Provider. Make a little library, connect your own provider and Infura, and then compare that both are behaving the same.

Should be easy to do.\nVerifiable chat system - most governance is about the conversation.\nLow level real time, high performance, contractually restricted chat. This is centralized, but data storage is decentralized and data content is verifiable.\nCan be encrypted using RSA\nWill spin out live chat for ecosystem - enhance dapps with real time live chat\nData

Let\u2019s keep the focus on EthPM here - we need to make sure as many people use it as possible! We should have done this a long time ago and we need to dogfood it as a community!","who_what":"I work at Consensys Diligence - focus on security of the ecosystem. Everything that is related to security: it\u2019s on our roadmap to tackle it.\n95% of our work today consists in doing security audits on smart contracts - any EVM-compatible or \u201ccompilable\u201d code. That accounts for building security tools that do the checks automatically, or that assist on manual inspection.\nThe goal is to eventually encompass everything related to Ethereum security.\nI have always been hacking - a grey hat of sorts.\nBuilt an ad tech startup, which had a built from scratch ad server that I did the architecture for.\nHad a mobile app to tell Portuguese people what was happening in their city.","tooling":"I used to use Remix a lot more than I do today (though I still use it heavily).\nUse it as a text editor, in fact, but mostly for debugger when I am auditing, especially when trying to prove\/disprove an attack I have thought up.\nVisual debugging feature helps me a lot. It\u2019s not perfect, though.\nWe\u2019re fans of dogfooding, so I use Mythril a lot, which was initially created by Bernard, but is now being developed by a bunch of people we hired.\nUsed mostly for automatic detection of errors.\nOyente is falling behind a bit, so I haven\u2019t used it in a long time.\nManticore is not built by us and does the same thing as Mythril (we have compared it). Though the inner workings are very different, the result is largely similar.\nHave played with, but never tried to integrate, Enchidna into my workflow, as it is difficult to work with due largely to deadlines.\nRattle is closed source, so haven\u2019t yet got around to playing with it.\nI extended a tool from Federico, who has an ANTLR parser for solidity, that is basically a viz and query tool for solidity contracts. Everything from inheritance trees to function call graphs and querying function paths in the function call graph. It is a tool to help with manual inspection particularly.","frustrations":"I really, really want a good visual debugger. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone on this one either, but I also don\u2019t think people are as passionate about this as I am.\nMy main motivation behind this is that I really like visual debugging and it is just so much easier, when debugging a very low level program, to have a visual aide.\nIt requires real experience to reason about things at a very low level and see the effect of each line of code.\nRemix, right now, has a very steep learning curve and we are missing the opportunity to make sure that every developer coming in gets clear insight into the nitty gritty details, the fine print, of the EVM that actually gives them full control over what they are doing and what they want to do.\nI feel that very contained environments are usually more appealing to people just entering the world of computers and programming.\nWhen Apple started with Swift playgrounds and lots of integrations, I saw a bunch of people just flocking into iOS development. It was just so easy to understand what is happening - it\u2019s all very visual and easy to grok.","testing":"Remix, Surya and Mythril as above.\nVery small number of instances where I need to do something off chain, for which I will then use Truffle.","missing_tools":"A proper, local dummy client. I love the Truffle team and I love Ganache, which I use a lot.\nI run a lot of tesst on Ganache, which are not seamless to run on other machines, so I would love a super seamless cross-platform client that has a great block explorer in it.\nUsing the visual version of Ganache about a month ago, I couldn\u2019t see events being fired, or various important details on transactions happening there. We need a more full-fledged local client.\nWe haven\u2019t really prepared for how to handle contracts across shards (coming months to years, who knows?).\nWe are looking mostly at tools to support the WASM architecture. This is likely the problem that will take the most of our time, I think. I have talked to Johan Barbie about this and I\u2019m not sure anyone has a very good solution for what a tool that would help scheme the interactions out actually looks like.\nI am personally more worried about language design stuff, and languages in general, than I am about the consensus layer, or anything below the language and application layer.\nWe are also working hard on updating our tools to support, for instance, Vyper. John has been doing a terrific job there, doing contract translations from Solidity to Vyper, built a plugin for Truffle.\nMythril will also eWASM at some point before it goes into production.","domain_questions":"What are the details\/patterns in smart contract audits you see often that people should not be writing?\nPeople are lacking the granular insight that is required - along with the right mindset\/philosophy\/paradigmatic approach to writing smart contracts. This goes back to the need for better visual tools, in my opinion.\nA lot of contracts do not acknowledge that they are operating in a resource-constrained environment. For instance, I see lots of loops - which is not a desirable thing when operating on top of Ethereum.\nPeople also don\u2019t have that \u201casynchronous mindset\u201d, unless you have been working with a very strange stack indeed. Even people coming from JS and pure node backgrounds - it\u2019s not quite the same thing.\nThey keep favouring push mechanism when there should be a pull one (or vice versa).\nIn reality, this is a very hard question. I do have a collection of very specific stuff I have seen people do wrong, but - in a very general manner - the biggest problem is bringing synchronous patterns into smart contracts.\nThinking of a way to have them do otherwise, this whole thing is promoted by people not getting what is actually happening beneath their code. They know it is \u201cdistributed\u201d, but what does that mean to them? Hence the need for something like a Swift playground in order to make it easier to grasp the use of resources on the network","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"Bernard Miller from our team, focussed entirely on Mythril.","best_resources":"I do this less frequently now, but I basically watch every interesting repo to know what they are doing next before any announcement or anything.\nI also spend a lot of time reading the docs in that repo. In fact, a couple years back, I would spend most of my time reading those kind of docs.\nAlso, the Ethereum wiki has a lot of super involved stuff that is not easy to grasp and there should be somewhere where those things are explained far more simply.\nAgain, I\u2019m a very visual guy, and that wiki really lacks graphics and images that could be really helpful in terms of giving a wider group of people insight into the innards of the systems.\nThings like RLP encoding, Patricia-Merkle tries, or the ABI sender (which I went back to over and over again until eventually getting to a sort of Eureka moment re encoding reference types). I feel like the tries, in particular, are very visual things.\nRLP graphic resources would really help because it is such a specific thing.\nThe Beige Paper is awesome, but it\u2019s still not the end game - it\u2019s too technical still with almost no visual guidance still requires a very big leap for people dealing with blockchain for the first time.","questions_to_ask":"","smart_contract_wordcount":{"topics":{"NFT":0,"audit":0,"blockchain":0,"bounty":0,"client":0,"community":0,"compiler":0,"consensus":0,"contract":0,"decentralized":0,"deployment":0,"documentation":0,"event":0,"gas":0,"governance":0,"hash":0,"network":0,"payment":0,"protocol":0,"signature":0,"solidity":0,"testing":0,"token":0,"transaction":0,"verification":0,"wallet":0},"projects":{"Augur":0,"Bamboo":0,"Casper":0,"Embark":0,"Ethereum":0,"Geth":0,"Gitcoin":0,"Infura":0,"MetaMask":0,"Mythril":0,"Parity":0,"Plasma":0,"Remix":0,"Sharding":0,"State

Decentraland at the same time.\nI used to work with Juan and 2 other guys who all joined the team at the same time. I really wanted to leave enterprise companies and loved the team already there.\nIt\u2019s about the open philosophy, and break down the walls around the 1% of the 1% and diffuse power into the hands of everyone.\nI was working on an online IDE for an in-house language at MuleSoft. Now the engineering manager at Decentraland.","tooling":"The whole Ethereum stack, basically.\nTruffle\nIntegration with common developer tools is not fantastic. We need to start thinking about and building our tools in such a way that is easier for the guy\/girl who comes after me to fix the issues that come up.\nIf we are changing the world, why are we still thinking in narrow ways about how our tools should be used and by whom?\nVS Code\nReact, typescript, nodejs\nBablyon.js as an engine for VR\nWeb3\nOne of team members rewrote web3 into typescript for EthBuenosAires and all the tests are passing! Will post a link here after the hackathon.\nThere were typos there!\nThere was functionality not working (and there are billions of $\u2019s running on top of it!)\nIPFS for decentralized deployments.\nScalability is a concern here. If we want to deploy the whole metaverse in IPFS, we actually can\u2019t. We need to replicate data in, I don\u2019t know, Amazon or something because we can\u2019t supply the level of connection we need to (just 100,000 users or so, not even in the millions). And even this will require bootstrapping nodes like crazy.\nThe IPFS cluster is still in alpha and not as stable as we need it to be.\nWe are waiting for scalability, but we don\u2019t have the tools to monitor and handle that amount of information anyway, and this is a concern for us.\nI haven\u2019t used this yet, but this seems to be an interesting tool: https:\/\/github.com\/nomiclabs\/buidler","frustrations":"Real monitoring information is tough to come by. I come from enterprise where this stuff just exists and the ability to fetch the data you want to fetch is never really in question.\nBrowsing through a node that has a huge list of unindexed transactions without all the information you need in an easily accessible place is hard.\nWith our own tools, we are building our own framework in order to move tx information from the blockchain to the db and from the db to the app.\nWe need transformations between each layer (which wasn\u2019t that hard to build). But now we need a really generic way to do this and to publish it for people building DApps and using our SDK. And with a centralised DB, this is not possible.\nWe are failing with dev tools in general.\nLet\u2019s think about Java a bit. You have the JVM, a mature language and a complete set of IDEs. You also have a tonne of framework for building Java applications. There are also great monitoring tools.\nLogging systems are a great and practical example of this. How can I log failures from Solidity without using events in a way which they weren\u2019t really intended to be used? We need a Splunk equivalent.\nTerraform, AppDynamics, etc - these things don\u2019t exist for blockchains and really need to be built.\nWe need to focus more on tech and shipping things and less on the people with money or how our token is performing.\nWe care about nothing but the tech we ship. We encourage others toward similar feelings ;)","testing":"","missing_tools":"Starting from the infrastructure stuff: we need a new language to describe all the set of things that you need to do in order to deploy one or more contracts.\nYou have you application made up of a set of contracts that are all talking to each other: we need a decentralized logging system to make sure they are all still working properly and the events that are being dispatched by the nodes are correct.\nA complete set of tools for testing. Truffle is not adaptable enough.\nThe work being done by Zeppelin on securing contracts and providing best practices around how to use audited contracts is great.","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"The Decentraland client!!

E.g. I prefer typescript over js because it behaves as expected and has been validated by the communicated. Java > python because it also behaves better and more in line with your expectations. I need a language with only one way to do things.\nIf Solidity fulfilled this, why do we need to test it with javascript?\nI never did any course, I just read contracts and code that seemed interesting.\nStarted with Zeppelin\u2019s ERC20 and went from there through GitHub and started writing little tweaks and commits myself.\nI had also had some experience with React, so that set me up well for DApps.\nHaving awesome and intelligent colleagues is such a bonus

Getting a response back saying 0x from JSON RPC for some very weird reasons, but doesn\u2019t handle errors in a great way. Better error codes. Wanted to jokingly call themselve the 0x company but it was already taken.\nLack of documentation, but it has improved a lot..\nDealing with the clients themselves, not using Infura. When you use clients directly and bypass Infura it can be painful to get things running.\nThere\u2019s no flow at all really. I would randomly learn a bunch of things but nothing flowed together. I bought Ether but didn\u2019t need it to actually build on the blockchain. Ropsten was down all the time. Did our stuff on other Testnets.\nMaybe we need to have a flow of learning the fundamentals.

experience with EVM\nAlex\nStarted with building dApps, contracts, UIs \u2013 everything was broken in 2015.\nThen jumped into proposing things and fixing things;\nSolidity\nTesting\nJavascript\nLed to working on testrpc & ganache-core\nWorked on Trezor, and build a dApp for it.\nEnded up with all these other issues: cpp-ethereum; testrpc; RPC methods.\nTried to raise issues, and sometimes they end up in improvements.\nSpends most of his time in Solidity design.\neWASM \u2013 started 3 years ago for 6 months \u2013 then took a big break \u2013 then now working on it for 3-4 months (really started in Jan).","tooling":"","frustrations":"Communication is bad within EF and within ecosystem in general\nPeople aren\u2019t aware of existing products \/ solutions\nDuplicate effort solving the

onboarding\nBecause of onboarding \u2013 not everyone\u2019s review is equal, takes some people with experience and insight.\nIt\u2019s very easy to block people\nGithub Projects kinda helped this process:\nOrganize features into versions.\nThey had a label for breaking changes;\nShould be clear from the PR list.\nBacklog is really large and growing. There\u2019s too much that we don\u2019t have enough time to get setup project management process.\nFor every PR, someone has to learn all the subsystems that are involved. Solidity is a big codebase.\nIt\u2019s a complicated codebase; needs refactoring\nThree ways of generating bytecode from AST:\nWay 1: cpp stream of instructions, values, and comments\nWay 2: append inline assembly\nWay 3: compile Julia into bytecode\nOur focus is moving to Julia, and using that to generate bytecode.\nWe\u2019ve planned a full rewrite of the \u201ccode generator\u201d subsection.\nBut they found a way to do it without a full rewrite.\nJulia:\nHas an internal AST, a parser, a syntax for the parser.\nBackends: which generate bytecode from the AST->EVM, EVM15, eWASM.\nTransformation steps: things that happen on the AST; could be built independently.\nThese exist for EVM and EVM15.\nBuilding these for eWASM could be a task.\nBut they\u2019re good on-boarding work for new contributors.\nThe external static analyzer:\nWritten in Javascript.\nCurrently part of Remix.\nTry to use a number of options that the compiler gives you.\nThere\u2019s no option to turn off warnings.\nTherefore: anything there is a warning, you should fix it.\nDelegating warning generation for things that are conventions to this external static analyzer.\nTwo major things to be done for bounties re the static analyzer:\nBounty #1) Separate it from Remix, and make it independent.\nBounty #2) It uses the old AST format, that the compiler used to generate.\nIn other words: the compiler parses, creates an AST (which is a big JSON object), which is then passed to the static analyzer\nThe new AST JSON is much more compact \u2013\u2013 but means that the static analyzer should be written.\nThis could be more iterative.\nMist has this notion that it has Solidity compilation built-in.\nConsiders \u201cwarnings\u201d and \u201cerrors\u201d the same \u2013\u2013 so throws.\nThe homepage has 1) old Solidity examples (which has errors), 2) recommends Mist (which throws errors for warnings).\nPawel:\nMaking cpp-ethereum more modular.\nStarted removing some parts, and moving it to different repos.\nTwo things:\nA Proxy for JSON RPC.\nMaybe should write the Proxy in Go.\nWhat it is:\nPreviously, we had 1) an HTTP server to handle the requests, and 2) some Unix sockets to handle other incoming requests.\nThe HTTP server is replaced by a simple Python script. Replaced the HTTP requests with a Unix socket requests, so same underlying system can be used.\nThere\u2019s no reason for implementing all the transport layers in each client.\nThis Python script only exists in cpp-ethereum, but should be included in other clients.\nOnly complaint about Python: it\u2019s hard to ship an executable object of code.\nA proxy for the p2p network stack\nSame as above, but for the networking layer.\nE.g. devp2p or libp2p protocols.\nYour application protocol (e.g. Ethereum or Swarm) connects to a new p2p layer.\nWe should instead use the same p2p layer.\nProblem: duplicated effort of implementing the same things.\nNeed a nice interface for inter-process communication.\nCan combine different parts of the stack in different languages.\nEVM-C: C interface for EVM.\nShould stay under Pawel\u2019s control.\nPotential bounties: create EVM-C bindings for different languages.\nE.g. Python, Go.\nCould be useful to have a fast EVM implementation;\nSame idea for eWASM:\nUse the same interface within go-ethereum to hook in eWASM.\nOther bounties?\nResearch for opcode gas

Having an external viewpoint would be helpful.\nIn the research area: due to the way research funding works \u2013 people publish the work, but do no maintain the software or integrate with other tools.\nIntegrating research software with development tooling & keeping them up to date.\nBig example: Formal Verification software\nFive or six tools that similar to Oyente.\nRemix has a plugin architecture \u2013 possibly supports Oyente.\nIdea for tool: being able to test very quickly if a contract implements an interface.\nThe problem is that you cannot enumerate the functions of a contract.\nThere\u2019s a way to resolve this.","who_what":"90% of my time: design of Solidity language and its implementation\nFormal verification part of the language \u2013\nDeprioritized over the last 2 months.

Only a PhD student right now \u2013 Jacob.\nA toolchain for creating ZkSNARK-enabled smart contract\nNeed help there, and can pay $ for it.\nWhy they haven\u2019t focused on getting more people, is the project management burden there.\nWhat kind of help we need:\nImplementation.\nThe project is a compiler that takes a high-level language, turns it into an arithmetic circuit. It\u2019s PoC stage right now. Also needs help with the direction the project needs to go. Needs an evaluation of use-cases.\nAlso needs people with cryptography backgrounds who can implement efficient arithmetic circuit gadgets.\nSomeone who can deal with Rust as a language; finite-fields.\nOpen-source on Github.\nPotential help: university research partners \u2013\u2013 Dan Boneh?\nIt\u2019s early, PoC stage. \u2013\u2013 currently the elliptic curve pre-compiles are too pricy.\nThe first step is to see how much it costs, and if it\u2019s feasible because of this.\nAnalyze use-cases, and see whether its not too expensive.\nImprove the trusted setup experience.\nSolidity?\nDevelopment resources: we\u2019re pretty much good right now.\nWe have issues marked: \u201cgood first task\u201d or \u201chelp needed\u201d \u2013 these are good to pick up by external contributors. They\u2019re small in scope, so maybe doesn\u2019t make sense for large bounties.\nUsually someone creates a PR, we have comments, they update the PR, we make comments, then the contributor loses interest.\nMaybe: could have a person who is responsible for external contribution across all projects?\nAnother project: analyze external contributions, and understand why they weren\u2019t completed. What was missing in the description \/ what was the issue? If you\u2019re creating an issue for external contributors, what is the detail \/ info you need so it gets picked up.\nWhere we need help:\nExternal people to translate the documentation.\nThis is a big effort. Requires management. Need to keep translation up to date.\nThis doesn\u2019t really exist right now. Only have a Russian \/ Spanish translation that are old and rudimentary.\nThere\u2019s people to do the translation \u2013\u2013 need someone to do the project management.\nMore feedback from people who try out the most recent version of Solidity before it is released.\nBefore \u2013 Remix was set to the most recent development snapshot. Now it\u2019s set to latest stable, so don\u2019t get immediate feedback.\nTruffle and etc only upgrade manually \u2013 so its more stable \u2013 but slows down the feedback \/ dev cycle.\nHow would this work:\n\u201cReminder: people please try out new versions.\u201d\nWay to give feedback exists: creating an issue on Github OR their Gitter channel.\nMost people can\u2019t use the latest the version \u2013 because the toolset doesn\u2019t allow it.\nAs part of the CI, we\u2019re running some tests with specific libraries.\nPossible solution:\nPeople submit their contracts to Solidity team.\nThey get integrated into their CI pipeline \u2013 every time a new version is pushed, their contract tests are run.\nWe get contacted if tests pass re new version working.\nTools for developing Solidity\nIt\u2019s written in cpp, we usually cmake toolchain for building, cpp-ethereum for semantic tests; thinking about switching to their own interpreter to speed up tests.\nUses cpp-ethereum with a few extra RPC endpoints. Let\u2019s you rewind the blockchain to a particular block. It\u2019s also allows you to modify the timestamp in the next block.\nThey\u2019re standardizing these API endpoints. -> include ganache-cli in these discussions?\nGanache needs to have this ability.\nHaving a testing only Ethereum blockchain\nHas a memory-only blockchain; is mainly meant to run tests on smart contracts.\nSimilar to ganache; but performance could be improved?\nGanache has a UI\nTo improve: high-throughput, many txes at once.\nNotes on IULIA:\nCompilation from IULIA to EVM is finished.\nOptimizer is 90% finished.\nThis is why the ABIcoder isn\u2019t out yet, because it depends on the optimizer.\nBig remaining chunk of work:\nWriting code generator to go from Solidity to IULIA \u2013 this is in solc.\nA year

came into Ethereum a couple of years ago solving bounties for VMs.\nOctober 2016 - became Head of Security at The Foundation.\nMonitoring mainnet.\nBeing able to react when there is a consensus flaw. Had an API call to geth, called getBadBlocks. Geth will save bad blocks and you can query node for it.\nSo, we run geth and parity simultaneously. Ask parity node for last block, ask geth for bad blocks, If they match, can see more easily why and who might have acted badly.\nBut can\u2019t do it vice versa - been nagging Parity to add that end point so we can do the same process in reverse.\nGeth client has a lot of metrics: how many i\/o connections, db writes, block processing times, peer connects. Can export from geth and display in any charting you like. So, that\u2019s exactly what we do; get nice graphs about tx churn, how txes were rejected, queued, pooled.\nOptimizations in geth which made block processing faster in the past month. You can also monitor for performance, not just security...\nShanghai attacks taught us that performance very much related to security.\nP2P network information, protocol dissector \/ analyzer -- if I can see what is happening on my node and what my peer capabilities are, what have they seen, etc.  Is there any one peer that is sending me transactions that I reject? That way, I can identify bad behaving or lying peers (more in-depth view of what people are telling me over the network)\nWould be difficult as an add-on (need node keys, decrypt data, etc.),  Much simpler to do within a client.  Protocol layer in Geth.\nBuild tools for analysis, especially when things are going wrong: hacks, network problems.\nE.g. transaction propagation when network was overloaded with txes going back & forth between parity and Geth.\nNeeds for lots of testing around hard forks as the existing tools were not sufficient to cover all cases.\nCoverage guided fuzzing - generate code and run on instrumented version of Geth \/ Parity. This matches code coverage, generates new code and increases coverage using fuzz tactics to mutate inputs and can test geth and parity differentially. Do they have the exact same stuff in the stack, in memory etc.?\nAnother fuzz testing tool based on EVM Lab that can generate tests for CPP ethereum and can cover py-ethereum etc by running in docker container with a switch that enables an output after every opcode and compare internal state differentially again. Run this 24\/7.\nCaught 5-6 consensus issues with this. Last hard fork was a controversy as Parity had done a whole bunch of releases prior to the hardfork and the suggestion was to postpone, which would have caused its own issues and forced clients to update again.\nIf patched before hard fork - no problem. Beat the drums and tell everyone to upgrade.\nIf you find a consensus issue on an existing client it is a bit more problematic.Telling everyone means giving people the chance to exploit it - tough to handle.\nExamples of consensus issues: make a tx which invokes a precompile like verify_signature and if that, in one case returns true and in another returns false, or if they cost different amounts of gas (i.e. x on geth and y on parity) then post-state will be different so they won\u2019t accept the same blocks and then we have a fork.\nThere was a consensus issue that happened after Spurious Dragon when we implemented state cleaning. Chain split for 200 blocks, which were created on the wrong chain that were then abandoned. Block 2 600 000 or so.\nDevelopers need to be alerted as soon as possible so they can fix it ASAP. People can lose money in the meantime, txes can be reverted. All exchanges need to be alerted to hold deposits and withdrawals.\nHave built tools to detect this, so we consider it solved from a technical p.o.v.\nRecommend that exchanges run all clients, but not sure if they do. Could be standardised with docker containers that could be more streamlined. Documentation around best practices, automated tooling etc.\nBuilding something like Ethstats but more detailed. If there is a consensus failure, you might want to see exactly which tx in which block caused it. Nice to see blocks, txes and intermediate root hashes between each tx. Then you can see different post-state hash, i.e. that is where we should start looking.\nNeed detailed traces of exactly what happened in every opcode of this transaction.\nOne of the things I built in EVM Lab is a reproducer. Synthesises pre-state for that particular tx, then executes it and gives you a detailed trace from geth and parity that you can then compare.\nNot much active development on EVM Lab. Use it mainly for investigating certain condition or opcode or potential attack. Pretty easy to put together desired scenario in an EVM assembly-like way by setting genesis you want and then run & benchmark it.\nIt is usable right now and I have no immediate plans to do anything in the near term. Might need some updates and it is not so user friendly.[a]\nOne of core devs for go-ethereum.\nWe want to expand - have 2 interns now, but had to turn someone away recently too. Send interested developers to Peter.\nWorking a lot with the signer, which was just merged in latest release. Standalone binary which can run off some secure enclave, USB armoury, parallel VM, some other machine on your network. Can be used for offline signing and has trusted UI.\nCan be configured with particular rules written i.e. in JS. Definitely needs more work on the UI. has implemented one in python-qt and python-cleft. Can also be run in a console, with remote ports etc so you can decouple pvt keys from your daily computer.\nHoping MetaMask will integrate with it directly. Has spoken with Dan and another guy called Jordan building a tool called (?) which has integrated it already.\nHard problem: how to make it more secure for end users. Surf internet with unpatched browsers with 0 days and they get exploited. How can we improve upon that so that you have a sign what you see flow. Submit a tx, see the details of that tx when you approve it.\nUnlock feature is most horrible thing he has seen where it will sign every tx sent to it for a given period.\nI don\u2019t do too much DApp development, so I\u2019m not up to speed with capabilities of current tools and how they have matured over the last 6-8 months.\nI have heard there is a debugger out now which I remember as being one of the main pain points.","tooling":"","frustrations":"Definitely a need for more developers, either full time or for some scoped project. And not just people wanting to work on ethereum-js!!\nProper debugger would be easy enough to scope out.

audits.\nWrite defensive code. Don\u2019t try to do crazy things.\nFor the first time, we\u2019re mixing two things that haven\u2019t been mixed together:\nThe two:\nCritical code \u2013 contracts holds money.\nOpen-source \u2013 everyone can see how it works.\nE.g. you don\u2019t have this in planes \u2013 critical program but not open-source.\nE.g. in a website \u2013 it could be open-source but not critical.\nSo you realize you need to write perfect code, but that\u2019s not possible. Because code is written by humans.\nIt\u2019s important to improve:\nDo not take risks.\nTry to isolate the critical part. E.g. if you\u2019re doing an ICO, don\u2019t hold the ETH in the contract, instead put it directly into the multisig.\nMinimize the box, with its known security vectors.\nOn one side, you have a blockchain that by definition that is immutable. On the other side, immutable is not compatible with making mistakes.\nHumans make mistakes. We are building things on top of that immutable base that could have mistakes.\nBut we need to keep blockchains immutable, because if don\u2019t, we lose their power.\nHow do we solve this?\nPossible approach is having a second layer \u2013\u2013 instead of ETH, we use an ETHToken. ETHToken has governance built in and can be modified. You build it in a more centralized manner, it can be changed; and then overtime, you soften the centralization rules, and make it decentralized (take away the authority, make it operated by a DAO, etc).\nE.g. having an escape hatch would be super helpful. If there is a hack, it could be sent to the EF or whitehat group. And then you can decide what to do. Better than it going directly to a hacker.\nAnd then you can build the smart contract applications on this second layer.\nWant to make decentralization linear; so you don\u2019t have to take the risks from the beginning.\nAll contracts in Giveth have escape hatches built in.\nSTANDARD LIBRARY for using ETHToken in your contract, layer for security, escape hatches => I think it might be a bit too early though since we\u2019re still figuring it all out. Other teams working on this include Zeppelin, Aragon.\nBetter compilers. Better testers. Better formal verification.

Why would people review this code?\nBut I have seen personally over the last year that big security holes have been discovered in bug bounties.\nBug bounties force you to write very good code.\nYou need to choose the right names for variables, document it, it needs to be understandable.\nGood resource: Consensys, on the history of all bugs. https:\/\/github.com\/ConsenSys\/smart-contract-best-practices\nThis wiki could be complemented with these more generic ideas \u2013 around bug bounties, reference smart contracts etc.\nMaybe even write a book around it.

full time to actually work on this stuff constantly and fix the long term incentives!!\nJust waiting for the Ethereum Query Language ;) :p","who_what":"CTO of Gnosis and is building a prediction market, ddex and smart contract wallets.\nStarted in 2013 - discovered that we could add prediction markets using btc escrow because that was missing (a p2p marketplace for predictions).\nJoe Lubin convinced us in 2015 to start a formal platform based on Ethereum, did the token launch and spun out of Consensus and begin working on the more fundamental problems\nDecentralized exchanges!! But not efficient on Ethereum today (scalability and number of participants). We have had to contribute to building the DDEX infrastructure.\nPrediction markets are a way to create new ERC20 tokens (conditional payment\/purchase). The value of those tokens is only defined at a certain point in the future. We can therefore create derivatives of other ERC20 tokens, which are more precise investments under certain conditions.\nDDEX allows people to trade the efficiently. It can be done in Ethereum on chain, but scalability, front-running and ease of use just isn\u2019t there yet (need everyone participating and having a global liquidity pool).\nDutch exchange implemented on chain to solve front running problems.\nIntegrating with USD price feed of Maker - was a little hard to depend on other people\u2019s infrastructure and therefore the tests that they have deployed. We ended up mocking their service for test net, would have been awesome to just point at their package, specify a contract on either network and go without having to mock any of the other services.\nMake sure that things like ETHPM are deployed across all test networks.\nAlso built the multisig wallet for our own token launch, has been very successful and we now want to offer the same experience for every user: more secure wallets for personal use that are even better than hardware wallets.","tooling":"","frustrations":"Secondary indexing of blockchain data!!\nOnly json-rpc calls to retrieve prediction market data would make it impossible for users to see what markets they hold tokens on.\nExpose state changes between blocks in an easy to consume fashion. Right now you apply txes, but you don\u2019t know what effect on the state is immediately. You have to assume that you know, or listen to events.\nBut events shouldn\u2019t even be there as they are just replication of info that is already there on the chain - just make that info more accessible and easy to read and use!!\nState changes between blocks, sort of like a github diff that you can take and use to index in a secondary indexer - that would be really helpful.\nWriting their own indexer specifically for prediction markets. So is Aragon, and even Augur is now doing it.\nMore client developers - too few people working down there in the protocols. Set incentives for improving the stuff - which is why ETHPrize is so important.","testing":"","missing_tools":"","domain_questions":"What does the Gnosis stack look like?\nContracts written in solidity\nMany pitfalls, especially for newcomers - need to read documentation 10 times and then sometimes you still don\u2019t get it.\nFor e.g. the low-level stuff like .call() is implemented differently from what you might expect that caused funds to get stuck in multisig contracts.\nThe concept of gas is not that easy to understand and is not transparent.\nIf you use .send() you use minimum amount of gas versus .call() using all the gas.\nVerification of code and garbage handling is not well documented - verifying down in the byte code is very difficult.\nParticular problem for symbolic execution and all the additional checks that solidity is doing. Not well optimized at all.\nIf you access a storage variable twice, you will always have to pay twice, rather than optimizing to keep it in memory - very annoying in the end. Means you have to do a lot of gas optimisations yourself which really should be automatic.\nThese kind of issues require domain expertise - why don\u2019t we all put up a $1 million bounty for a new smart contract language\/compiler.[a]\nMight be interesting to keep it lower level, something similar to Vyper with the much simpler bytecode and cheaper execution, better verification etc. We cannot have only one smart contract language.\nUsing truffle framework because it is most used framework and want their codebase to be as approachable as possible.\nDebugging is an absolute pain in the ass - even truffle\u2019s debugger is not great. No easy breakpoints, difficult to step through easily, or change variable to run different kinds of tests.\nWould be better to statically typed testing environment - only test framework in JS (python one is not maintained). We need another framework that can go deeper and be more precise.\nWeb3 itself really sucks.\nAPI versioning for ethereum json-rpc stuff. No versioning, no documentation, no proper error codes. Plenty of useful calls that are missing, plenty of calls that exist that no-one uses and it\u2019s just chaos in general. We have to assume what version is running on the user end, so have to assume they are running all kind of different versions.\nEveryone using MetaMask and Infura makes this slightly more hidden.\nI proposed a new json rpc call but geth ahd already implemented it, but it was documented nowhere and Parity hadn\u2019t really thought of doing it at the time, so there is no clear way of defining what the standard is.\nWas about allowing users to sign offline transactions in a specific way: ask the client to sign and return the tx data that can be then used from an offline location.\nWe need a test suite against the json-rpc API: just to test that Geth and Parity are actually behaving in the same way.\nUsing Remix IDE - then go to local text editors for further dev once they are sure the contracts run well.\nWould be amazing to have a properly integrated environment. Uses Atom with solidity linter. Would be great to be able to do proper debugging in that environment as well. Things work now because complexity is relatively small - but as soon as you want to integrate between projects it becomes a total mess.\nGas metering and fuzz testing in addition to break points, stepping through, and changing variables easily.\nUse Mythril to check smart contract security, executions and test coverage. Aim for 100% code coverage and use solc code coverage.\nWould love a tool with some basic checks (like overflows etc), but needs to be extended to do optimisations for gas efficiency, standard way to apply smart contract best practices automatically.\nMap test coverage to code execution paths so that you can easily see which cases to write tests for. Something better than code coverage which only shows where you touch the line so that we can cover the most important scenarios (i.e. where things are failing).","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"","best_resources":"","questions_to_ask":"","smart_contract_wordcount":{"topics":{"NFT":0,"audit":0,"blockchain":0,"bounty":0,"client":0,"community":0,"compiler":0,"consensus":0,"contract":0,"decentralized":0,"deployment":0,"documentation":0,"event":0,"gas":0,"governance":0,"hash":0,"network":0,"payment":0,"protocol":0,"signature":0,"solidity":0,"testing":0,"token":0,"transaction":0,"verification":0,"wallet":0},"projects":{"Augur":0,"Bamboo":0,"Casper":0,"Embark":0,"Ethereum":0,"Geth":0,"Gitcoin":0,"Infura":0,"MetaMask":0,"Mythril":0,"Parity":0,"Plasma":0,"Remix":0,"Sharding":0,"State

colleagues. Don\u2019t see us using formal verification unless that process is made easy, but I don\u2019t think that will happen. We will stick to security audits. Thoughtful in how things fit together and are secure.","bounties":"Gas profiler 100%.\nWould love to see an Ethereum Virtual Machine written in JavaScript. The Ethereum JS VM written but it\u2019s a little bit bulky. Important to offchain application, important for state channel applications. Richard Moore is writing this.","who_what":"Started Horizon Blockchain games, building decentralized multiplayer games. What we\u2019re excited about is a new class of video games, in which players truly own in game items. Own them, and can trade them. They can even compete cryptographically to earn\/unlock new items.\nOne of the core areas of work that is started immediately: how can we make high fidelity games that are scalable, low-cost, and provably fair. Video games with a decentralized economy. Can mine new items as part of the economy.\nLove building new models on blockchain. What is most excited to do is to create utility through video games via blockchain.","tooling":"We\u2019ve built a blockchain gaming architecture with a low fungibility token, similar to ERC 721. We built our own state channels. We\u2019ve also created offchain game logic, and can verify the game in a single state. Skyweaver.net was our very first game. All work will be open source, won\u2019t do an ICO.\nGame is offchain, persist the awards on chain. Based on a finite state design.\nUse Truffle, Ganache-cli, write the infrastructure in Go. Geth is written in Go, that\u2019s very nice.\nClient side application, standardize on Ethers.js (Richard Moore). Without Metamask you lack adoption. Ethers.js is being ported to Typescript, excited about that!\nWeb3.js has a lot of dependencies, large in filesize, and the API is not as compelling as Ethers or productive. Just too bloaty. Was great that it exists, but want very very lean tools. Ethers is just so active and very tight. Following newest standards and practices. Back the guy with the deepest knowledge.\nTruffle is really cool. Helps with Developer workflow, but we spin up own testRPC service with Ganache. Truffle helps with deployment of contracts as well as package management. Truffle is now a monorepo, I pushed them to become a monorepo.","frustrations":"Need more example of really great dApps, more high quality examples. Zeppelin is doing a great job of making a standard library, but more interested in end-to-end. Don\u2019t know of great examples of these high quality dApps.\nScalability is super important, when state channels and plasma channels arrive the whole game changes. Want to see good convergence in state channels, need off-chain computation. Want to see good collaboration here.\nFocus more on end-user. Improve onboarding to Crypto.\nWhen people think about scalability, people think about throughput and performance. But cost is integral to this. But what is the transaction cost. Optimizing for cost is a form of scalability.","testing":"Do it in Typescript with Ethers.js and Chai and Mocha. Use Remix Solidity IDE. Amazing IDE for testing little blocks of code. Testing would be another great things to see more examples of Ethers.js","missing_tools":"Profiler at ETHDenver, to see gas costs.\neWasm will be game changing. Potential for having other languages target the EVM will create a more productive developer experience.\nVyper will be great. Their goals are twofold, improved security through usage of the language. Learning from Solidity. Security + productivity.\nReally happy with seeing progression of Solidity. As cool as ewasm is, who knows when it will be ready.","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"Wrapping your head around the architecture. Very multidisciplinary. And the tooling is in flux. Lack of examples. Architectural issues. Costs are fundamental thing.\nEthereum coding is really like developing for an embedded system with little memory, storage, and cpu power. Unfortunately don't encourage beginner to be writing this stuff. But getting better.\nTry to map existing architectures to existing things that people knew about. Realizing how everything fits.","excited_about":"Blockchain video games.\nVery excited about Casper+sharding. The team is doing incredible work.","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"Richard Moore,\nCTO of Dencentraland. Esteban Ordano. Great guy, very knowledgeable.\nLiam Horn, should pick his brain. Very hands on in Solidity.","best_resources":"Point them at Blockgeeks, all about Blockchain development education on Ethereum. Plus searching Twitter and Github, look for those great open source dApps out there. Look for examples of end-to-end dApps\nCryptoZombies created a rad Ethereum tutorial.","questions_to_ask":"AwesomeList, community curated high quality tools. Ethereum website needs to be completely redone. Here are the awesome projects, here are the awesome tools, here\u2019s how to get started. Same with website work.\nExactly Ethereum Foundations problem, do not want to make any opinions that aren\u2019t in community consensus. People voting for what they want worked on. People can vote on things. Certain weight to reputation. Consensus machine to conduct this type of thing.\nWith a footnote, don\u2019t need to perfect this system.

Imperative language and everything on blockchain is declarative. Solidity should be declarative.\nIVY is best example of for blockchain language. On blockchain control logic is impossible: blockchain never decides how or when a function is called. No such thing as on-chain control logic: off-chain controls how humans can manipulate state.\nAll lies: completely wrong tool for blockchain.

proper security against malicious actor (can\u2019t simulate those kind of network conditions easily). This is where fuzzing would be really, really useful. Try to understand how contracts could be exploited in ways that the developers can\u2019t directly specify in tests.","bounties":"","who_what":"Working on dispute resolution through smart contracts\nArbitration - process to decide who is right\/wrong. Looks more like an arbitration DAO - system of incentives.\nEnforcement\nDecision-making\nIncentivising people","tooling":"Smart contracts - Remix\nBeing able to copy address directly is really cool now.\nStopped using remix core because writing tests in truffle is actually quicker than clicking everywhere through the `remix IDE.\nSolidity - can\u2019t do operations in bytes. Want to split bytecode into address and integer and there is no easy way to do that. Could write some assembly (difficult to understand) or some hacky workaround that uses a lot of gas.\nByte manipulation is really needed in Solidity.\nAdd a solidity linter to Remix (already exists in Atom at least, but would be nice for having a properly integrated environment).\nWe really need a light client to use a DApp on a smartphone.\nTruffle to run tests\nRelying on other random libraries sometimes breaks things. If you use a library for tests that is not being used by your contract. I.e. it is very difficult to customise tests in truffle and you have to know some (undocumented) tricks in order to get around some basic stuff.\nBetter testing is required, more extensible and adaptable. We don\u2019t need over-engineer things, but a better debugger and a properly integrated environment is necessary.\nTruffle doesn\u2019t work with latest solc - keeping all the tools in sync and up to date is a tough task and it delays and blocks developers from using the latest tools if they have not yet been supported across the ecosystem.\nNo warnings for deprecation!!\nFrontend - ethers.js to communicate due to instability of web3. React, redux and redux-saga. Architecture with an API that is used to share methods needed to use Kleros easily.\nEthers.js is not well-known and it would be better to standardise things and have a  common library for everyone to use.\nMain issue with web3 lies in callbacks. They don\u2019t use promises because the 1.0 version does not support them well.","frustrations":"We REALLY need a very good web3 tool that is actually stable - the errors returned through the json-rpc are impossible to decode and find info on. Making this library more performant is a key issue.","testing":"","missing_tools":"A tool to analyse security of smart contracts better, especially complex smart contract suites. Very excited to see formal verification, whenever that comes out.\nFuzz testing is super important!!\nGreat to use truffle boxes, but all of them are unstable and not well maintained. Would be great to see more effort put in there.\nTrying to implement chain-view: a tool to share the workflow of the ethereum protocol with the clients. Mostly used to analyse transactions (i.e whether they are successfully included in a  block) Can be very useful for client-side devs and i.t.o providing end users with transparency.\nNot open source currently.","domain_questions":"Pre-interview review from Nico:\nIt would be great to have a language like python, C to build smart contract to avoid learning a new syntax even if the syntax solidity language is good like the viper project (https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/vyper). The developers lose time to learn it.\nTo have a js tool to communicate with the node it is very stable and useful. We have encountered many problems with the web3 library. The library https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/web3.js\/ (0.14.0):\ndependencies installation sometimes broke\nuse callback (promise is much better)\ncallback to know if a tx is mined break sometimes\nSo we choose to use ethjs.js instead of this tool. Apparently this has been fixed recently in version 1.0. But I haven\u2019t tested it yet.\nAn easy tool to make a hash with a salt. It\u2019s very difficult (for me) to find a library\/hash function with the same hash than ethereum even more when there is a salt (https:\/\/gist.github.com\/f43d7807b69402060dd6e4c8db730afc.git)\nA boilerplate to build a dapp like http:\/\/truffleframework.com\/boxes\/. The last time I tested this tool it was very unstable, so we prefer to build our own boilerplate .https:\/\/github.com\/kleros\/dapper.  A very good tool like this can be very useful for the developers to easily build a dapp with all tools to communicate with the ethereum protocol.\nA tool to sync the front-end state with the ethereum state like drizzle http:\/\/truffleframework.com\/docs\/drizzle\/getting-started\nI haven't tested this tool yet but I was told it was unstable.\nTruffle doesn\u2019t support the last solidity compiler (0.4.22)","hardest_part":"Building safe smart contracts takes a lot of experience and understanding of game theory, cryptography, complexity skills and an insight into the edge cases that can be used to exploit certain patterns and implementations.\nThere is no single point to learn about all these domains, so it can be really challenging to get exposure to all of the required fields, and eve to realise that these fields are important to writing good SCs.","excited_about":"Decentraland rocks!!\n0x\nTruebit\nProof of Stake in general will be very important going forward. In fact, everything that allows for scalability and lower tx fees with higher tps is absolutely critical.\nIPFS is interesting too - right now they are hosting some part of the website\/DApp themselves and that constitutes a central point of failure, so easy-to-use and maintain decentralized storage would be really, really great.","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"","best_resources":"Github and Reddit are the most useful.\nr\/ethereum sometimes has posts with a lot of documentation and that is almost always a great place to start.\nTrawling through GH issues looking for the comment that leads you in the right direction.\nReadthedocs is also super useful - esp for Truffle and Solidity.\nCan be very fragmented - there are a lot of sources and some are out of date etc. Not necessarily too bad to have a lot of sources as Google can generally lead you to the right place.\nGitHub should be the hub for developer documentation particularly.\nWhen I can\u2019t find a solution, just googling is always very helpful. Sounds cliched, but someone else has almost definitely had that problem before. This often leads to a gitter conversation and the dev channels there tend to be fairly responsible.","questions_to_ask":"","smart_contract_wordcount":{"topics":{"NFT":0,"audit":0,"blockchain":0,"bounty":0,"client":0,"community":0,"compiler":0,"consensus":0,"contract":0,"decentralized":0,"deployment":0,"documentation":0,"event":0,"gas":0,"governance":0,"hash":0,"network":1,"payment":0,"protocol":0,"signature":0,"solidity":0,"testing":0,"token":0,"transaction":0,"verification":0,"wallet":0},"projects":{"Augur":0,"Bamboo":0,"Casper":0,"Embark":0,"Ethereum":0,"Geth":0,"Gitcoin":0,"Infura":0,"MetaMask":0,"Mythril":0,"Parity":0,"Plasma":0,"Remix":0,"Sharding":0,"State

This is amazing.\nI\u2019m switching between Solidity \/ Go, or Solidity \/ Javascript\nSolidity Javascript bindings through Truffle are good.\nIntegrating libraries designed for cryptocurrencies with front-end apps is hard:\nBundle sizing: different behavior if you\u2019re running in the browser or in the backend.\nE.g. if you compile a contract with truffle, you get a JSON file \u2013 which has the bytecode and all this stuff beyond the ABI.\nThis is heavy and unused.\nCrypto.js has unnecessary dependencies:\nEth.js includes an ASN.1 parser which parses digital certificates \u2013\u2013 which isn\u2019t needed for any crypto.js uses.\nGoogle Chrome places a size limit (3 MB) on service workers in Incognito mode.\nBundle sizing is important \u2013 need to take out dependencies.\nStandardize the interfaces for all these libraries.\nE.g. a standardize library to read BIP39 seed words \u2013 across different programming languages.\nIs there a Javascript API to boot a testnet, deploy contracts, and run tests against it?\nFor running application tests \u2013\nI want integration tests that run against Truffle easily\nHaving the ability to do this via Javascript is important\nE.g. automate this: https:\/\/github.com\/machinomy\/machinomy\/blob\/master\/run_integration_tests.sh\nPeople don\u2019t know how to productionize a geth node:\nOn Ubuntu: you can \u2018apt-get install geth\u2019\nNow, how do you secure it, monitor it, etc?\nPeople say: \u201cjust use Infura\u201d \u2013 but then you\u2019re tied to Infura.\nSome ideas:\nDocker instances; Chef or Ansible scripts; that setup a Geth node which has a bunch of best practices around it.\nAs an example:\nYour RPC port shouldn\u2019t be open to the external world, but should be accessible to the front-end.\nYou need a layer sitting between the geth node and the external world, and gives: 1) analytics, 2) authentication, and 3) audit logging.\nThe dashboard could configure geth on the fly.\nHow do you secure a geth node with an RPC port:\nNeed only certain keys to be allowed to interact with it\nJacky:\nIntegrating Metamask with Dapps\nBuilding a new wallet for Spank;\nIt\u2019s a service worker\nThree threads running at once:\nRuns a bunch of background processes\nThe Wallet\nThe Dapp itself\nThe messaging between these three threads sucks.\nCross-window JSON RPC library.\nWallets are pushing the limits of what Chrome is capable of.\nThey\u2019ve had to file two bugs with Chrome in the last month.\nRuns into the service worker size limit.\nMostly Javascript and Web3 work\nLot of code repetition in loading state and confirming transactions\nWeb3 is kinda hard to use \u2013 large ABIs\nBiggest problem has been around event management.\nKey management is not that complicated \u2013 Web3 has a good handle on it.\nThe Web 3 interaction with the wallet:\nWeb3 provider talks to the blockchain \u2013\nSpank and Metamask \u2013 the provider is an instance of the ZeroClientProvider \u2013 written by the Metamask team\nThe ZeroClient makes all calls when there\u2019s no key needed.

than lowdash where I pull specific utils out.\nReact \/ Redux.\nNeed a way of shoving Web3 stuff into your Redux state.\nManaging the lock state of your wallet\nE.g. you need the lock-state of the

things:\nLeading the development of counterfactual: a generalised state channels framework and protocol. It\u2019s a simple, intuitive framework for developing DApps using state channels - so we do a lot of work on Solidity code and general work around EVM interactions.\nCo-founders of ETHGlobal - so I spend a bunch of time talking to hackers and making sure that these events represent genuine progress and that people aren\u2019t just stuck on bugs. The output to time ratio needs to be as high possible.","tooling":"Truffle suite.\nHighest level comment: nice for specific use cases, but our use case does not match this. It\u2019s built for writing a bunch of contracts, deploying them and interacting.\nOur whole framework is based around off-chain interactions, for which Truffle is not well suited.\nThe whole Truffle networks thing is kind of annoying. If you want to ship a simple build that you put in your browser and run, it doesn\u2019t work locally. You need to set up your own test environment.\nWould be great to have a tool that could put together a super minified version of your ganache DB so that we could test across the same data.\nWe did some of this, but it\u2019s not well known and not the default across the ecosystem.\nUse ethers.js a lot\nABI encoder v2\nNot supported by truffle.\nGanache\nCan be very unreliable for a lot of important things.\nE.g. bug in ecrecover on bytes (even if signed correctly) it will not return the correct address, It is just not implemented correctly, so we had to port over to Parity.\nHowever, the parity dev client doesn\u2019t throw errors on revert, it just logs them, and there is no option to change this.\nThe fact that the behaviours are different between these two things is concerning and frustrating.\nParity and Geth\nI don\u2019t understand why there isn\u2019t just one-click Ganache replacement. If I just went to parity.heroku.app with a big button to launch an instance, that\u2019d be awesome. Seems like low hanging fruit that could really be quite easily worked on.\nGetting around all the configuration details is such a headache.\nI just want to launch testnets, and even do so locally in a way that actually works in practice.\nAnything to do with solidity at all really.\nLibraries and tools\nRemix\nPlaying with rust for its ability to write once, run everywhere.\nTonne of JS tools to quickly iterate\nTypescript  - state channels need to run in the client, you want to be able to have code client side to decide what to sign and whether it is safe, and this is easiest in typescript. Would be better in WASM, but it\u2019s not there yet.","frustrations":"Better UI testing. Would be awesome to have am MetaMask mock - wanna launch Chrome Canary, Safari, Moz and ganache will auto inject into the page some provider that could be used to test the full flow. We have also started work on this.\nWe need more to more people working on ethers.js!!\nIt is the best library out there, especially for quick operations, and we need like 5 more people at least working on it,\nWeb3 is too opinionated about exact use cases, whereas ethers is much more generic and simple and can have a lot of tools built on top of it.\nWe have been hesitant to develop non JS stuff, and haven\u2019t yet because there is no ether.js equivalent. If there were an ethers equivalent in Rust that would be awesome.\nIn terms of solidity: ABI encode and decode (not written well yet, but will be super useful) are really game changing! It should be 0.3 or 0.4 or something!\nReally bad documentation, especially around nuances to do with memory or storage objects etc.\nWhen things happen in solidity, what you can do with it is not explained well.\nFor instance, one thing you can do is now use returndatasize to get the output bytes from some call you make. The minimum amount of code you need is a few lines of assembly.\nHowever, this is not well known or used.\nOur whole system is based on off-chain contract, and the rules in there need to be enforced by on-chain contracts. So I need to be able to interpret arbitrary function calls based on arbitrary logic\/user input. This is very hard\u2026\nWe do conditional payments, and these ensure that a bunch of things  are true, and then interpret the results of a bunch of functions and then take those outputs and pay people. All of these inputs, not contracts, and it gets complicated.\nThere is a specific error called unimplemented_error which comes up in a few cases. The only way to figure this out is to google it and there are 3 or 4 options to pick from, which seems sloppy.\nError messages could be much more specific about WHAT is unimplemented.\nWould be great to see also in the docs WHY certain things are not yet implemented.\nThere\u2019s some subtleties around exactly how libraries work in solidity. Will send through more details when editing.\nWould be nice to have a debug mode for events, so that they will trigger regardless of whether or not there was an error so that we can use that as a console.og\nAlso, there should just be a console.log ;)\nIf you emit an event with a dynamic struct and pass it a dynamic struct, the whole thing doesn\u2019t make it back in the logs: it only shows the top of the event. It certainly doesn\u2019t show the whole thing.\nWhenever you hit gasLimits, you should be able to find out easily where it stopped and what line it is stopping at.\nBetter documentation on the assembly command sand specific example usage of them would be really good.\nBreakpoints with context - these are the variables and scope etc. I will sometimes play around with delegatecall and then I don\u2019t even know which context I am in anymore and this can block me for extended periods of time.\nThere\u2019s a bunch of sneaky tactics: like keyless signatures. There is a way to generate a sig for an exact and specific kind of tx from an account whose nonce is 0, because then the create opcode gives back a deterministic address.\nPlease can we document this!? There should be a person on stuff who just plays around with this stuff and then documents it.\nThis is very serious stuff, if there were a keyless-sig library, so many other things would also be available.\nBetter google results for Ethereum!\nMore literature on how Ethereum can be used to do the things people think other blockchains are better at.\nHighlight ethresear.ch and some post sthere, like one from Vitalik about businesses paying gas fees for their uses, which is EOS\u2019 biggest argument.\nEven worse, explaining plasma, where it should be feasible to have no fees at all.","testing":"","missing_tools":"WASM is likely most useful for us medium term.\nState channels are very light in terms of the actual contract code. But the off-chain contract code is a lot more complicated. It would be nice if all of the things we\u2019re doing were easily runnable in the browser.\nWe have this concept of a module, which is some software that wraps a particular state channel application. We need code running in the client that determines whether or not it is safe to sign the next transaction, and where you store it, if you show it to the user at all etc.\nWe then have to implement a copy of what the contract does in JS and it would be way nicer if we just had a local environment to run some eWASM code because then we wouldn\u2019t need to worry about the node at all. We wanna have it work in any random browser and WASm enables that.\nPlasma and state channels require stripped and straight forward teams to work on this stuff that can build out all the tools we need.\nTruebit is exciting.","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"","easier_expected":"Ethers.js.

Matt was running into same issues -- things were too expensive and some really bad UI in general.\nThe project evolved a lot: the initial idea was called ETHDeploy.

Doing something with Loom had potentially a much bigger audience and more use cases.\nStill need transaction costs on main-net down!\nOur argument is that not everything involves high storage of value \/ sensitive data (doesn\u2019t need full decentralization), but we still want important parts on main-net (character data, owning items)\nDelegate Call (first app): users earn karma and tokenized karma they can transfer to mainnet for contributing to site.\nCould load cryptokitty into platform (ERC-20 + ERC721)\nStoring hashes of large amount of data verifiable on side chain.

Built our own deployment script to get around it though.\nTest, compiling and running are cool, but none of them are linked very well.\nBeing the devs of both ganache and truffle -putting the scripts together that would run the whole suite would be awesome.\nNeeds easier integration with CI tools.\nTest scripts from zeppelin (in the sol libraries that pulls up testrpc, gives it a bunch of accounts and then executes whatever you have written).\nDive into lower level Ethereum libraries a lot - ethjs-utils especially.\nYou have to understand what is going on and WHY you\u2019re doing it. This context is tough to get across and the libraries here are just not as well advertised, which is a pity.\nIt\u2019s a maturity thing: early on you\u2019re just trying to attract people and get them to get their hands dirty. As the community matures, you need more forward-facing, lower-level libraries that are well documented available is absolutely key. You can only do so much with vanilla web3..\nOne of their new implementations is a new multisig wallet, picking up some stuff from ERC 191, added some things to address security concerns.\nNone of that stuff is in web3, so using ecsign method from utils in order to avoid going onchain all the time to get info that is available elsewhere.\nMore attention around lower level components is useful as we mature.\nEthereumjs-tx, ethereumjs-wallet, solidity-sha3, to get identical hashes\nLittle bit more control to JS devs.\nWeb3 1 looks good\nBiggest mistake: made it default installer when web3 v1-beta came out and this is a crucial error!!\nBut scrypt is such a heavy package to deal with. We use that for local encryption\/decryption now. Can it even be compiled into an Electron app for instance?\nNecessary because everyone running full nodes is never gonna happen.","frustrations":"","testing":"Just Truffle for tests\nMocha for unit and functional tests. Use mocha across the whole application base.\nHave run Mythril on some mission critical contracts\nWas a pretty good experience\nStay away from monolithic code bases, iterate and test as regularly as possible!\nApplies especially to smart contracts\nUse event logging to debug contracts if possible\nGetting invalid opcodes as feedback when your code doesn\u2019t run is the single most frustrating thing in the world!\nThis has now improved a lot, which is awesome! Not just OOG errors in solidity anymore.\nFinished contracts a few months ago and now don\u2019t really want to touch them too much. However, solc moves on a lot and there is a tension there (especially after audits)\nSC dev is much more like traditional application dev, not web dev. Updates are months apart and very purposeful, bundle a bunch of things etc.\nWe like solidity, and most problems are related to VM not being as capable as people currently want.\nThere\u2019s a language called Jelly with very purposeful functions that are then linked together to create compound functions.\nSomeone wanted trailing and leading 0\u2019s from contracts return data - seemed very easy to do in Jelly. Specifically, bytes are so valuable on the blockchain and we use more bytes than we need to.\nRoom for optimisation with bytecode there.","missing_tools":"The community is doing a good job and a lot of the stuff we need is already being worked on by someone.\nETHDenver and the gas visualisation tool that came out of that.\nBecame apparent that there are places where you see red and you can\u2019t change that and these sorts of insights are useful - do I really, really need to put this piece of data on chain etc.\nMore visual tools that you could wrap around smart contract code (that doesn\u2019t get compiled).\nHas there been any thought around wrapper code for SCs for developer-specific tools or libraries that give you the visuals you need to understand more of what is going in.\nHaving a logger that works well and you get outputs similar to solidity-coverage and doesn\u2019t only point out errors, but also information - showing scope and which state variable it has access to etc.\nThink about in context of Parity issues we had: the fact they tried to structure a lib as a contract could have been picked up by something like this.\nOr, in Ownable contracts, specifically printing out a report that says \u201cThe owner of this contract is the only one who can access this specific state, as opposed to other users\u201d etc. Point out how to establish an owner (if not already set in initialisation function).","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"Having a sequential getting started stuff on ethereum.org is totally, absolutely necessary.\nList of tools and resources and even an appendix-like structure of what things like Distributed Applications even mean.\nDefining use cases for those don\u2019t wanna be in blockchain is still really hard today.\nSolidity readthedocs is very good though. Web3 v1 is much better documented too.\nThere is a disconnect between web3 v1 and latest geth: the way we were fetching tx receipts were not syncing correctly\nv1 websockets are still kinda screwy and not handled as well as they need to be.\nEnded up putting the service using the node in the same container and just ipc\nResources themselves, you really need to dig for.\nGeth has resources that are very outdated and fragmented - please can we fix this!\nNot having definitive resources and docs is a big problem in general.\nSearch github and Reddit to find random answers that I need.","excited_about":"Proof of Stake overlays will be really interesting!

At team of 20 it\u2019s different; have to revamp internal policies; reminding people of things.\nFound 2 Slack admins not have 2fa on.\nWe are bigger target; we get password resets.\nSomeone stole her number in October but they were prepared for it. They handled everything really well.\nDNS and internal security on infrastructure.\nHired ex-director of security for Coinbase & Facebook. Works on board of Hackerrank.\nHow we hired: people who use MEW want to keep Ethereum & MEW safe. We connected on security. We had a call that afternoon.\nHe does amazing security incident response & red-teaming.\nFEW DIFFERENT SECURITY CONCERNS:\nHow we serve their code: a commit is pushed to a specific branch; that is served to github.io; then AWS pulls that code, caches the hell out of it, and that serves MEW.com.\nAll keys are rotated, and ssh private keys are kept very secret.\nmulti-stage pipeline (Github + AWS); both have multi-factor security, need Ubikey, etc.\nIt\u2019s kind of a staging pipeline.\nPrevents bad commits or bad UI changes from getting into the website.\nHow do you QA things, how do you test things?\nWe wait 24 hours from creating a release and getting it on a live domain.\nWe have a series of tests \u2013 check that everything compiled correctly, check that all links have a rel=no-opener on them, ..\nDNS\nAfter EtherDelta and ClassicEtherWallet.\nWe have a custom thing: three services to monitor the site.\nWe serve through a CDN\nDiff the code \u2013 diffs the new website with the previous version of them.\nGets the hash of the Javascript and CSS with previous versions.\nBlockchain security\nEnsuring the user makes good decisions \u2013\u2013 how do you alert or notify a user when is doing something wrong \u2013\u2013 e.g. notifies you when an Ethereum address is not formatted correctly?\nHow do you build this: check the balance?\nHave microservices that have micro-databases of the blockchain.\nCaching token balances.\nOn MEW: pulls everything from Parity or Geth directly.\nCan run their infra through Cloud Formation \u2013\u2013\nGeth falls out of sync.\nCryptoKitties destroyed their infrastructure.\nIntel chip thing then took them 120% CPU usage, took them offline.\nFixes for Spectre and Meltdown.\nPROBLEM: phishing & supporting after the fact.\nPROBLEM: infrastructure:\nKeeping nodes Parity & Geth up all the time.\nAdditional issue: Blockchain naturally re-writes itself if you\u2019re on a microfork. If you\u2019re also distributing this across your own database, then you need to write code to also rewrite this. Etherscan just gave up and booted up from the blockchain from scratch.\nThis is what Infura is trying to do. They are in the same situation as MEW and Etherscan. They are under Consensys so have more financial freedom.\nShapeshift sysadmin stole money. If they had the problem, then this is a big problem.\nWhat is the cost of security in this space? How much a malicious people could stand to gain\u2026\nWith a debit card, it\u2019s not the same \u2013\u2013 there is risk of getting caught, the original person gets the money back etc.\nTraditional security systems won\u2019t work for this.\nWhen I worked at AT&T, I asked people how they trained people to not steal simcard numbers. The real cost is not cost of buying a phone.\nUNEXPECTED PROBLEM: building remote team culture\nI work well remotely; but building culture while remote is really important.\nIn-person hangouts \u2013 all devs will be at EthDenver.\nMake them talk about personal stuff on calls.\nBig question is to: how to make remote team work.\nDanielle leads the dev team.\nOver the summer, they did a hire fast fire fast mentality. Sink or swim type of game. People need to be able to orient themselves.\nPeople in the beginning need to be able to make sense of the chaos.\nRandom people contributing on Slack or Github.\nFor support, hire top Reddit commenters.\nGive people 30 days and see how it goes.\nEthereum Blue: anonymous team, with a token. Promoted themselves as Metamask Blue. Scam.\nTeams that are dealing with public crypto token world:\nSwarmcity. Super resilient team. First fight against Arcadecity. Then theyy got their funds stolen out of their multisig.\n0x. Did an amazing job about education around ICO. Each blog post had a full section on how to protect yourself + custom tools.\nGriff\nGriff + Hudson Jameson from EF are the people to call. They know everyone and who to get involved. Like a connective tissue. Response to Parity hack.\nGriff had learned a lot from the DAO hack.\nHudson was at Cornell with entire EF security \u2013 just happened to all be in the same room.","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"","best_resources":"","questions_to_ask":"","smart_contract_wordcount":{"topics":{"NFT":0,"audit":0,"blockchain":0,"bounty":0,"client":0,"community":0,"compiler":0,"consensus":0,"contract":0,"decentralized":0,"deployment":0,"documentation":0,"event":0,"gas":0,"governance":0,"hash":0,"network":0,"payment":0,"protocol":0,"signature":0,"solidity":0,"testing":0,"token":0,"transaction":0,"verification":0,"wallet":0},"projects":{"Augur":0,"Bamboo":0,"Casper":0,"Embark":0,"Ethereum":0,"Geth":0,"Gitcoin":0,"Infura":0,"MetaMask":0,"Mythril":0,"Parity":0,"Plasma":0,"Remix":0,"Sharding":0,"State

kit that builds a bridge from Web2 to Web3, nice interface so that people don\u2019t need to have understand blockchain to use it.. Need to get users on the technology.\nWe have to be very pragmatic. 3 core regions to be make technology accessible by millions:\nManagement for users and development\nDefine a token for an application, how would you use it for your company?\nBeing pragmatic about scaling, a Layer 2 Solution. Not really sidechains, all value is only defined as value of ERC20.\nCircumvent boundary of the bridge with a business solution.\nWe put quite a lot of effort into this, they had 2 main concerns. Auxiliary systems, have to be natively compatible with many chains. And want to be token compatible first as opposed to be block first.\nHad a bad experience with Ethereum Permission Client, had some incompatibilities on ABI level so had to do their own tooling.","tooling":"From an IDE perspective: Tried to use Remix, but not so easy to set up locally. No finalized IDE. It\u2019s powerful but not easy to set up, very complicated to set up and not so stable.\nWeb3.js Intense users, but don\u2019t like how they handle callbacks. New documentation is not yet complete. Want more examples on web3.js. Better documentation.\nOpenOSTBase- a bunch of wrappers around the websockets around web3, make these more reliable and redundant. In production, things tend to break but this helps with that. Happy to contribute back :)\nWeb3.js is a first level API. First layer access to the technology, but want to have a more user friendly second layer that caters to the community needs. More user friendly, without having to do the same thing several times. We want a second level API, a helper or utility level API.\nWhat tools don\u2019t exist at the moment?\nHaven\u2019t super explored Ganache but is interested in more things done via command line. Any type of automation that can be done from the command line is cool and greatly helps with efficiency.\nBiggest thing we are missing is an IDE suited for the ecosystem. Something that could do a gas function on Remix done on runtime, you could see security things happening on runtime. Integrating Remix with a different IDE, it\u2019s currently statically bound.\nClear explanation in Documentation.\nGeneral level: a big proponent of multiple chain universes. In OST users only really interact with Ethereum mainnet, only have tooling directed towards one chain.\nSolidity perspective, have a diagram based solution to see all the connections. Solidity codebase diagram module would be very compelling.\nHow do you handle smart contract verification and security?\nGuiding principles: observe standards and don\u2019t invent funny ways of doing things. Trying to reduce code to smaller components and go from there. Had 3 security auditors. Cure53 reviewed contracts and all traditional architecture. Zeppelin did audit for smart contracts.\nNow working on the hardcore protocol. TrailOfBits builds a lot of interesting tools examining the bytecode. This is not an easy task. Trying to take very small steps one at a time and then go from there is the philosophy.\nThey are excited about ewasm. They respect work done with Solidity, but bytecode is the biggest thing. They have compiled with same Solidity on Mac and Linux for same thing and got different bytecode, this is a big concern.\nCompiler, assembly tools, and debug tools are all major points of interest. Could be interesting if Solidity compiles to wasm, then you have portability.\nWhat was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum?\nTo set up the first private network was somewhat difficult. Didn\u2019t use Truffle, just Geth. Geth is very powerful but is missing good documentation and had to Google.\nSolidity is good but needs better docs and better exampling. Very happy with CryptoZombies tutorials, want to see more things like this to help intro new users into the space.\nHardest thing when you deploy something is deploying a smart contract that intends to have value but not having a way to walk it back. In the last weeks running up until their deployment, did 8 dry tests with a self-destruct button. Ran this 8 times on Ropstein testnest, and then mainnet. Very interested in smart tooling to help in this process!\nMore tooling for testing of deployment. Testing where deployment happened properly to avoid situations like Parity Wallet. Had Monex with EthPM like tool. Scripting the deployment. Testing the deployment, could be a part of an automation toolset. Like fastlane for ios and android deployment.\nWhat are you most excited about in the short term?\nGetting OST to version 1.0 :) But beyond that most excited about ewasm. Also excited about Whisper and Swarm.","frustrations":"","testing":"Using Truffle. Have a setup where for local dev purposes are tested on one chain. At a later layer they are tested on a testnet.\nOne cool thing we would be interested in: very close adaption between local environment and staging. Having a seamless way of transitioning from local to go to staging on Ropstein\/other testnet, flip a an environment variable and go from local to staging.","missing_tools":"","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"","best_resources":"","questions_to_ask":"","smart_contract_wordcount":{"topics":{"NFT":0,"audit":0,"blockchain":0,"bounty":0,"client":0,"community":0,"compiler":0,"consensus":0,"contract":0,"decentralized":0,"deployment":0,"documentation":0,"event":0,"gas":0,"governance":0,"hash":0,"network":0,"payment":0,"protocol":0,"signature":0,"solidity":0,"testing":0,"token":0,"transaction":0,"verification":0,"wallet":0},"projects":{"Augur":0,"Bamboo":0,"Casper":0,"Embark":0,"Ethereum":0,"Geth":0,"Gitcoin":0,"Infura":0,"MetaMask":0,"Mythril":0,"Parity":0,"Plasma":0,"Remix":0,"Sharding":0,"State

researcher independently.\nI was the developer relations manager at 0x.\nI am now focussing on state channels, signature-based improvements in general smart contracts, blockchain storage (utilising merkle trees and improving best practices).\nWorking with a gaming project that utilises state channels, unrelated to Raiden.\nA lot of things that could be done off-chain by simply using different signatures: for crowdsales instead of using on-chain whitelist, you send a signed message for every participant and then they need to pass that message along with sending their Ether. Used by Polymath to get around the gas costs (could cost up to $15 000 just to whitelist everyone).\nWorking with chronologic on Ethereum Alarm Clock and other secondary markets, e.g. conditional execution where I want to make sure if x happens somewhere on chain, then do y.\nRight now smart contracts don\u2019t listen to each other and require 3rd parties to watch the chain and inform them.","tooling":"Using Truffle, Ganache, testrpc\nMost of the tests are not run in parallel, under-utilising my compute resources, can\u2019t be adapted easily or extended.\nRemix for quick prototyping\nActually quite enjoy using the debugger - I find it fairly easy to use. Would be great to play with single function testing locally so that you don\u2019t have to run a full suite to test one or two things.\nTypescript (mostly for testing)\nMostly following 0x standards - transcribing from typescript to js that make it really easy to define statically-typed tests.\nMocha, chai","frustrations":"","testing":"I struggle with fuzzing: it\u2019s very useful for when different people are working on the same standards  - so we could easily run fuzzing between entirely different teams and see if the way they implement all the functions behave the same way and make sure the different implementations of the same standard are the same. Better standardisation is key.\nWrites unit tests myself and try for 100% coverage.\nI uses Mythril and am looking forward to formal verification.\nStandards checking!! Here is a standard, put your contract next to it and check that it conforms to the standard implementation and then reuse a lot of the unit tests etc. that come with that standard.","missing_tools":"Nothing exists for state channels regarding how you pass messages and other p2p tools that allow different agents to communicate easily with each other.\nNot easy to document this.\nNo easy way to test how peers are interacting with each other and you want to run simulations in state channels.\nScheduled transactions: we need a queue to avoid race transactions, can help lower gas costs. But we need off-chain system for nodes to communicate in order to implement that.\nEasy to use and easy to test frameworks for this stuff is going to be super important.\nWould be awesome to have some kind of simulation tool for multi-agent networks of this kind (even relevant for whisper and other parts of the Ethereum network, like zeppelin doing token mechanics simulations and analysis, especially around bad agents). More of a research tool than developer specific.\nSimulator for the cross-client, cross-account signature schemes and management - right now the only way to test these schemes are to actually plug in a ledger and then test. Would be great to be able to test this from one place!\nCouldn\u2019t make this work in Truffle, passing in byte code and passing. But then, using mycrypto or Remix, it failed because the encoding, libraries and dependencies are different!!\nVery confusing how bytecode arrays are passed in different tools and how you can convert from one type to the other, how we could concatenate a range of arguments in a single contract and then vice versa. Figuring out how that works (argument encoding) is really difficult to get right.","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"Coming from a non web-dev background and more from data analytics meant that everything related to async was difficult to grasp. It\u2019s unintuitive.\nSolidity dev is not particularly difficult, but the best practices are extremely important and it is only really by experience that you learn the best and safest patterns. You need to know most edge cases and most potential attacks before you can write contracts that can actually be used.\nReading about past exploits really helps. Ethernauts is really great.\nEach opcode and how much gas it costs - there are tables online, but not updated and it takes some time to search properly the Yellow Paper. In fact, anything related to code optimisation could be really cool to see.\nEducational content focussed on code optimisation. Has not seen as much of it as he has of security and both are equally important. I.e. \u201cTry to rewrite this contract in under 5000 gas\u201d kind of thing. Who can achieve this, this and this with the least amount of gas.\nNow implemented: https:\/\/g.solidity.cc\/","excited_about":"95% of the projects are not ready for the mainstream. Mass adoption necessarily requires state channels or plasma, or secondary consensus layer like a sidechain - so that is where we really need the most development as soon as possible.\nLoom network etc. is also really exciting.\nSharding comes later, and is really exciting, but the stuff above needs to happen first.","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"","best_resources":"","questions_to_ask":"Mostly about tools and enhancing developers lives.

ad-hoc.\nA common format for the tracing RPC calls, so tools such as QuickBlocks which rely on the traces would be easier to build.\nI use Parity. I can\u2019t switch to Geth because they don\u2019t share the same interface for the traces.","who_what":"QuickBlocks works with the Ethereum blockchain from the data side. How does one get usable, fast data out of the blockchain (as opposed to putting into the blockchain with a smart contract for example). Our work is fully decentralized (gets all of its data directly and only from the node); We take a bottom-up approach. We run for particular accounts or groups of account, not necessarily chain-wide. We retrieve and store only what the end user asks for.","tooling":"","frustrations":"Biggest concern: The idea of decentralization is being lost\nPeople are developing applications that are highly centralized, because it\u2019s practical. Many projects promise they will one day decentralize, but I\u2019m concerned that this will get increasingly more difficult as the technical debt grows. Many projects are deeply relient on highly centralized infrastructure (Infura, EtherScan).\nConcern: The law of unintended consequences:\nIdentification Systems\nEase of use is very enticing\nBlockchain based identity is easily applicable for government use\nBut...what happens when a \u201cbad-actor\u201d government or an oppressive regime requires citizens to all have unforgeable identity. How will innocent people who are legitimately against the regime hide themselves?\nI wrote about this here.\nReputation Systems\nIf we move to a world where everyone has an immutable reputation--by definition half of the population will always have a worse reputation than the other half. Due to the nature of feedback loops, this feels like a bad idea.\nConcern: The data is too difficult to use\nPer Account Lists of Transactions:\nAccounting for both incoming and outgoing external transactions is easy. Just scan to and from fields looking for a given address.\nAccounting for outgoing message calls (Etherscan calls these internal transactions) is also pretty easy. The smart contract itself initiated the message call -- send an event.\nAccounting for incoming internal transactions is very difficult. One must look at every message call generated by the entire system to fully account for all incoming internal transactions (witness air drops). I wrote about this here.\nBloom filters:\nEvery transaction receipt has a logsBloom field. These are \u2018rolled up\u2019 into the block level. Blocks also have a logsBloom field.\nAs the number of transactions per block increases (as it has done), the block-level bloom filters are getting more and more saturated. As they become more saturated, they will tend to report more false positives.\nAt the receipt level, the logsBloom are probably under-utilized (that is, they could hold more information without a large increase in false positive rate).\nThese two factors tend to make the logsBloom field both less effective than it could be and at the same time require more storage than they need to.\nI wrote about this here.\nFurthermore, the bloom filters exclude certain \u2018addresses\u2019 that, if they were included, would allow us to implement an RPC entry point called \u2018eth_listAddressesInBlock(bn)\u2019. This would be a compromise between a full index of addresses per block and re-scanning every trace for addresses if one wanted to build a list of transactions per address (which one would want to do if one wanted to audit a smart contract for example).\nWhat QuickBlocks does: Do not store either the block level nore the receipt level blooms from the raw data. Instead, at each block, build an enhanced bloom filter which (1) includes every address involved in the block including those used as \u2018data\u2019 for internal transactions (ERC20 transfers and air drops), fill the bloom filters to a predetermined level (configurable, defaults to 200 bits), and when one bloom fills up, create another one at the same block. Result: significantly less storage devoted to blooms, consistent level of false positives resulting in less overall searching, ability to quickly answer \u2018is this address used anywhere in this block\u2019 with perfect fidelity.\nInefficiencies\nSept-Oct 2016 DDos transactions make requesting traces astronomically slow. I wrote about this here and here. Suggestion: easier way to identify (and skip over) dDos transactions.\nWhen you use \u2018eth_getTransactionByHash\u2019, the RPC does not return the transaction receipt. In order to get the receipt, you must later call \u2018eth_getTransactionReceipt\u2019. You need the receipt to understand if the transaction was ended in failure. Twice as many calls to RPC than needed. Suggestion: staple the receipt to the transaction with an optional parameter to eth_getTransaction.\nTransaction Error Codes prior to Byzantium Fork:\nAfter the Byzantium Fork, getting the error status of a transaction is easy. If the \u2018status\u2019 field of the receipt is zero, then the transaction ended in error [There may be some edge cases here, we are reviewing this claim].\nPrior to Byzantium, one had to search every transaction trace looking for a trace that contains the word \u2018error\u2019.\nIf one is doing historical analysis prior to the Byzantium fork, or trying to gather lists of transactions per account, one has to look at every trace.\nCore developers seem more focused on what\u2019s happening at the front of the chain (understandably); rather than getting the data out of the chain. Even though getting the data out is as important.\nSuggestion: It would be useful to include a status field in pre-byzantium receipts at the option of the caller of the RPC.\nThe need for ABI definitions\nGet Solidity to make the ABI available, because it makes analysis simpler.\nGet people to understand the importance of providing ABIs.","testing":"","missing_tools":"","domain_questions":"QuickBlocks is Ethereum-centric; works on Ethereum derived chains.

amazing. Do really comprehensive audits.\nHave also used formal verification tools: most often Mythril, sometimes Oyente.\nI am also aware that the invariance checks etc. are also created by humans, so might not be entirely comprehensive.\n3 levels of checks: write code, write tests for the code, pass to another engineer to check, then formal verification tools, lastly do the audit.","bounties":"","who_what":"Blockchain engineer, working in the space since 2016. Mostly as a freelancer, helping companies solve business problems using blockchains.\nMiddle of this year, started Samsara Protocol. Started with idea of selling real estate on chain, and decided to use a raffle based system to do this.\nAbstract idea from property to raffling all kinds of assets.\nSmart contract developer in general.","tooling":"Use Truffle heavily.\nStill a long way away from good debugging tools.\nUsing Remix out of habit, especially to check and step through opcodes.\nRemix to dig deeper into what is going on with my solidity code. Especially the debugger there to dive into the EVM.\nHave got used to the debugger here, but it is still so obscure when something throws an exception and difficult to find out why.\nI have developed some intuition for this, but it\u2019s really, really difficult for people just beginning.\nNo break points!\nUse open zeppelin as reference for smart contracts - have worked on some educational projects with the Zeppelin team.\nNo issues with this. Haven\u2019t looked into zeppelin_os yet.\nBut the idea is quite interesting - upgradeability and on chain libraries are cool.\nTruffle-flattener library - make all your modules into one file. Use this to deploy, rather than doing it file by file.\nReact for frontend stuff.\nWeb3 to hook it all together.\nWebsockets (wss) are tough to work with. Having difficulty connecting to them through the infura nodes.\nOverall, really happy with the new version - it solves a lot of problems, particularly around signing transactions safely.","frustrations":"Syncing my node to the chain has become really difficult. I used to do this a lot last year, but now I use Infura because the node is so heavy\/hard to maintain and it is just easier to do it this way.\nNot at all good for fast development cycles.\nI have learned to embrace how slow testing can be because everything is async there.\nFor the raffle system I need to draw a random number, and right now this is kind of impossible in the EVM. The holy grail would be to produce a really random number at compilation time that cannot be tampered with by miners etc.\nRight now I am just using an oracle to do this.","testing":"I test in JS - unit tests mostly.\nOn average the ratio is 15:1 testing to smart contract lines of code and this can cause things to be quite slow, but it\u2019s still good practice and seems necessary for immutable contracts.\nOverall, quite happy with what comes out of the box with Truffle.\nHave only added await async calls to make things easier to read. Have some Mocha extensions added for the same reason.\nPrefer readable code, rather than fast code, especially when it comes to testing.","missing_tools":"Would be nice to have a tool that could get bytecode and re-engineer it into solidity code.\nSometimes I want to check if a function or some functionality and, if the contract has been deployed but not verified, it\u2019s not really possible.\nOpen source block explorer.","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"Really excited about the research around scaling Ethereum. I am myself working on side project to do state channels.\nThere was an awesome lecture at EDCON, and was super inspired by David to try it out myself.\nNot necessarily in the next 3 months, but there are so many ideas out there that it is bound to be exciting for anyone getting exposed to it.","easier_expected":"I was pleasantly surprised the first time I connected to a node using Infura, to the point that I decided then and there to not use my own node.","people_talk_to":"","best_resources":"What I love about Ethereum is that most of the code is out there in th open - so I go and read it.\nI often go to the Aragon repos and check out what they are doing and how they do it.\nAlready mentioned the open zeppelin library.\nThis is how I learn - just keep up-to-date with the best teams and the latest features the Solidity team is rolling out.\nThe solidity readthedocs is pretty good.\nI have written some blog posts myself about how to do things in the Ethereum ecosystem. I sometimes go back to these and they are often very helpful.","questions_to_ask":"","smart_contract_wordcount":{"topics":{"NFT":0,"audit":1,"blockchain":0,"bounty":0,"client":0,"community":0,"compiler":0,"consensus":0,"contract":0,"decentralized":0,"deployment":0,"documentation":0,"event":0,"gas":0,"governance":0,"hash":0,"network":0,"payment":0,"protocol":0,"signature":0,"solidity":1,"testing":0,"token":0,"transaction":0,"verification":2,"wallet":0},"projects":{"Augur":0,"Bamboo":0,"Casper":0,"Embark":0,"Ethereum":0,"Geth":0,"Gitcoin":0,"Infura":0,"MetaMask":0,"Mythril":0,"Parity":0,"Plasma":0,"Remix":0,"Sharding":0,"State

ones. I have a repository with proof of concepts of most of them, and I run unit tests demonstrating the bug and the fix, in that way I have a practical view of the known security bugs. Then I try to audit my contracts using the knowledge I acquired and the tools available, mythril formal verification, mythril analysis, manticore, porosity","bounties":"I think anything related to ease the whole lifecycle of developing Smart Contracts is a good candidate. A good IDE (or plugins for existing matures IDEs), with integrations to common services and tools like embedded 1 click debugger, 1 click deployment with builtin interaction with on chain contracts would be a game changer.\nAnd like I said, a good project that can make average users to use Smart Contracts without the need of handling the private key, secure it, go to an exchange and verify their identities to get ether, then use complicated processes to do a simple thing would help a lot to gain adoption, which is very important (even if the network and technology is not completely ready at the moment for that)","who_what":"I am a developer, working in London for the last 4 years, I love coding in general, but also security. I am joining ConsenSys next week and I am working in several side-personal projects, including the solidity-graph-debugger","tooling":"Well, it depends, when I build tools related to Ethereum, I tend to use the Java ecosystem (Java8, Maven\/Gradle, Spring if it is a web application, etc).\nWhen I am writing Smart Contracts, I use truffle for building and testing, intellij with Solidity plugin as IDE, Ganache, Mythril for formal verification, etc.","frustrations":"Maybe it is my fault, but I would like to see more tooling around other languages (especially Java, that is the one I am more comfortable with), but I know some people who are working on it at the moment, like Conor and his team from blk.io, they are doing a great Job.\nI am not a huge fan of JavaScript, and most of the modules are more maintained in JS (which does not mean better code!), so sometimes I have to adapt and use them. Anyway that's not a huge deal, I am not that extreme and I am fine with using any tool that can help me to achieve whatever I have to do","testing":"For unit testing I use truffle, I write JavaScript tests, it works great. I use Mythril if I am auditing my contracts, I identify some really important invariant and I write a little script to formally verify it, and Mythril is great for that. Manticore can also do that, but didn't have the time to test their scripting APIs (something I have pending)","missing_tools":"Good question, there is a lot of ecosystem that has to be created. The most obvious thing, would be a graphical debugger that is what I am building, but also dependency management tools, good IDEs (intellij solidity plugin is cool, but like everything right now, it's a bit green), better documentation tools, clients for pretty much everything, an easier way to interact with contracts for the average non technical user...","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"Scalability improvements.

Also Conor Svensson, interesting to see what he is trying to do regarding with tooling in general and adoption of different ecosystems","best_resources":"I would say no books, because they get outdated 1 week after the release, read the official documentation and start straight away to test things by themselves. Fight and fight more, then read again the documentation to grasp things that were missed the first time, then keep practising and do that in a loop until things start to make sense. Then I would try something like Cryptozombies, to learn a practical point of view, and solve Capture The Flag challendes, like OpenZeppelin Ethernaut or capturetheether.

Informed by practical problems, just getting ETH. Cold start problems. Ways of getting around this, using Gas Relay. What would be interesting iswhere dApps, applications have pre-funded. EIP-186 where you can have the dApp pay for gas.\nIt\u2019s going to delve more into identity based solutions. That\u2019s what really needs to be worked on, that first-time UX down so a mainstream user can use this. We need to figure out the UI\/UX. One click Amazon shopping is the standard. We have to solve the problem.\nThis breaks down into two things, part of it is a multisig wallet solution. It\u2019s very scary and you have 0 Eth and you\u2019re interested in Ethereum, don\u2019t lose your private key! This is like Internet cash, but I\u2019m used to forgetting my password. Fund recovery for a new user. Once you have value, you can learn about private key, about mnemonic. Funding something that makes multisig easy to use.\nThe cold start problem, not having them to pay the initial gas costs when they don\u2019t have value. If you can solve those two things, mainstream adoption.\nI think having a dedicated layer 2 talks specifically could be interesting. Layer 2 solutions are the solutions that scale. Get more Layer 2 solution widespread. And then a lot more collaboration between projects. Projects that need Layer 2 solutions could invest into a fund that is a common platform so not everyone does their own solution. To keep it very practical, want to incentivize everyone to share the knowledge. Could start a DAO to automate this, could get some funding via token inflation. They are working on this DAO on the side but there is still some aftermath for the DAO,. Providing this structure to have people come together on projects as opposed to one project.","who_what":"Work primarily with Spankchain, doing state channel research\/implementation. Also worked on Adtoken, first production release of TCR.\nI can preface this by saying this was all informed initially by experience with online ads. In online advertising, I had to deal with scalability and scale. Helping run a video advertising exchange on the supply side, on a slow day did 4-5 billion events a day. In online advertising, had to start at scale.\nBefore online advertising was in gaming, needed to be 100% in uptime. Game used AWS\/EC2 at the time.\nLooked at Ethereum, had scaling problems. Looked at all these initial options early on. In Adtoken, for the TCR did the groundwork for serving ads. Had concept of verifiability.\nKnew about the concept about state channels, was waiting for them. Ethereum community does a great job at being able to explain things and have docs, but lack of production projects.\nOpportunity with Spank chain to hit the ground running and implement into production, learn by doing. Alternative approach with state channels and dove right in. So much invaluable info you learn when you have contact with reality.\nComing tools for layer 2 tooling. Need to have these standards, but don\u2019t quite exist yet.  This is all informed by practical implementation.\nAlso work on a DAO that helps multiple projects that need state channels.","tooling":"We use Truffle, and Ganache on the web3 blockchain side of things. On traditional web2, use node, Kubernetes, Docker (traditional scaling pipeline).\nEtherscan to verify transactions\nIt\u2019s a lot of looking at Github issues. Have to support multisig contracts.\nOn the front-end React\/Redux.\nRely heavily on Infura, Metamask. Have their own state channel wallet, users fund SpankWallet with Metamask and then they open these other state channel with card.","frustrations":"When I\u2019m doing unit tests in Truffle, not knowing where the revert came from. Have been talking to the Mattis network, they focus on plasma. If the contract throws or reverts, it will tell you the line number.\nWriting the smart contracts is 20% of it, testing is more like 80%. Being able to have better clarity and visibility on the tests would be great.\nMy biggest fear or anxiety would be knowing if there are any bugs are in the smart contracts. Trail Of Bits has been working on a Fuzzer, having tools like that is would easy a lot of frustration.","testing":"I test and retest. Wrote the auction contract in Spankchain, the only payment channel auction ever. The contract itself was 150-170 lines (including comments). Had to document well and had 3 audits, but tests were over 2200 lines long.\nThis became a distraction. Had to create a testing DSL. Had to test for success and for failure. Had to test for strange modifier behavior. Had to lock myself in a room for a few weeks and think of every possible scenario and test for itself.","missing_tools":"I wish and a hope there is bachelor\u2019s in blockchain. In blockchain, you have to know legal, economics, game theory, some coding, etc. Here\u2018s the best curriculum so you can understand for yourself, is this mechanism design good. Some cryptography. Need to be able to give people the fundamentals. Need a broader view, not just technical.\nThis is why it\u2019s so fascinating, you can go down so many rabbitholes. It\u2019s intimidating, if you had a set course curriculum with the basics. Here it is, it\u2019s starting to happen. Cryptoeconomic primitives. Teach people beyond the code.

There is interest there. Learning how to run and operate a businesses. This is what is also really needed in the space. There are analogies to the beginnings of the Internet. How DNS became DNS. This would inform, this history you don\u2019t really hear about. How did social games become mainstream? Was FB leveraging off of Myspace? What were those key learnings there? Ethereum as a technology, getting a healthy mix of people that have been there and drawing analogies and lessons at a higher level can be extremely useful\nList of successful operators that have done 2-3 exits in companies before. The space can move very fast. Needs to be rounded out by successful operators and implementers. Instead of writing papers, let\u2019s implement it. You get the real life pain points.\nState channels don\u2019t matter if you are still like, \u201cHow do you begin?\u201d Can be more open about failure, be more honest about this. Harder to learn from success than to learn from failure, good to have a safe environment to learn from failure.","best_resources":"Depending on the background, a lot of it is hard because the docs get stale so quickly. Hard pointing them to the right version of things. When people ask, they just train themselves. They build their own blockchain developers, he teaches Solidity classes.\nDon\u2019t point people to any one example, his tactic is to give them a couple of books like Radical Markets and 5,000 Years of Debt.

Have to have the real-world conversation instead of academics. Need to get this feedback and keep going. People wanted to play Farmville just because it was up, this is what informs him now.

They also have a built-in censorship infrastructure now (supposedly only to use against phishing sites, but potential is there for anything)\nTestnets like rinkeby make you sign up with your facebook account or something to get coins\n Solidity compiler misses some trivial optimisations, has odd limitations like max number of local variables, and handles memory vs. storage qualification in subtle ways","testing":"Custom test harness, could never figure out how to get truffle to do what I needed","missing_tools":"Hmmm, a good light client implementation so everyone doesn't centralise around infura\/etherscan, although that ship has probably already sailed","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"Working around web3\/metamask bugs","excited_about":"Building out our product, watching adoption grow.

lot on Embark.\nBackground: I came out of TransUnion and the financial industry.\nI write smart contracts mostly related to SNT use cases: Tribute to Talk; smart contracts to control spam; a set of contracts related to identity and recovery and to allow users to register their Status ENS domain.","tooling":"Embark, obviously!\nNot just a framework for web applications - it lets you create properly decentralised applications.\nYou can build an app and then forget about the process of uploading to distributed file stores and setting up a lot of the infrastructure.\nEmbark uses web3js-1.0, which is useful because there are a lot improvement encapsulated in that library. I like the style of coding you have to use - promisfying everything, every communication with EVM is done asynchronously.\nVS Code locally and Remix to test contracts.\nWorking between them and copy-pasting between can be a real hack though. So, I start on Remix and once I am sure it is working and stable enough, I move it into VS code.\nSometimes I also use Truffle because I like the debugger they have.\nA lot of tools from the JS ecosystem: node-js, React, webpack.","frustrations":"Working with MetaMask and your local node\/test environment is often unstable and connecting it locally can lead to strange issues that are very difficult to debug, as your contracts work fine in tests, but then fail arbitrarily in the browser.\nNot having breakpoints in Solidity is hard. It would be awesome to able to see more clearly the flow of the code and follow things through the stack with some suggestions\/explanations.\nLast week, when deploying some contracts through Embark, it just read my contracts as interfaces and so didn\u2019t compile them.\nNot an Embark error - it comes from solc, because there was an error about the \u201cstack being too deep\u201d which happens when you have more than 16 local variables (which is not well documented anywhere that I know about).\nThe error behaviour in general is weird and difficult to follow. Better documentation around this area in particular is very much needed.\nSeriously though, most of my frustrations are related to debugging.","testing":"Mostly through unit testing in Embark. I created a new feature for it (not yet released yet) that lets you create a small scaffold for the unit tests you need for any given contract.\nAfter executing that functionality I can then populate the code for each individual test, and this saves a lot of time.\nNot really using verification tools right now.\nHandle code coverage with solcoverage.","missing_tools":"If I want to build things that are secure AND cheap to use, this is really difficult because we don\u2019t have an existing scaling solution.","domain_questions":"Let\u2019s talk about Embark further. What do you see as the most important tools you\u2019re building?\nEasy storage\/uploading to Swarm and IPFS. Swarm in particular as IPFS support has been there for a long time.\nSwarm has unique support for DApps and we are building some examples that use state channels and other interesting scaling solutions being developed.\nThese sort of example projects (well beyond SimpleStorage) allow us to put ourselves in our users\u2019 shoes and understand what can really be done and where the pain points most often are.\nEmbark is planning to integrate the Remix debugger as well.\nTracking how the value associated with variable changes in the course of running specific transactions etc. is a very important feature for us.\nEmbark also has Whisper support, which can still be improved a lot.\nRight now, we try to simplify the experience of using Whisper, but it therefore lacks some flexibility.\nI am not able to specify a private key that links to a public symmetric key. E.g. when working on the gas relay node (a node-js service that subscribes to a whisper symmetric key) and we have to do it manually using the web3js library because the whisper functionality provided by Embark specifies the keys automatically and it is not currently possible to change them.\nWhat is the gas relay node you mentioned?\nIt lets you perform transactions without actually holding Ether. It works by sending a signed message (through Whisper, or p2p, whatever). The signed msg is parsed by nodejs service and it will use the ETH that service has to create that transaction for you and will deduct the amount of required tokens from the account that sent the signed messaged.\nIt is ready to be demoed internally, but we need some additional input.\nThis solution needs to be included in the app, the desktop app, and perhaps even in the mailserver nodes, so requires a lot of feedback from our different teams.","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"Status!!!\nPlasma cash is really interesting and I follow it closely. Omise Go is an impressive team.","easier_expected":"Learning solidity and writing your fist smart contract is actually very easy.\nIt\u2019s the edge cases  and optimisations that are hard ;)\nThere are some good best practices that you can follow pretty easily and all the big hacks have been well documented, so researching why they happened is easy and will teach you a lot about writing better and more secure code.","people_talk_to":"","best_resources":"Subreddit for ethdev and stack overflow, as always.\nCryptozombies is cool.\nI learnt SO MUCh about smart contracts from ethernauts.\nI like reading HackerNoon on Medium - there\u2019s some interesting stuff there.","questions_to_ask":"","smart_contract_wordcount":{"topics":{"NFT":0,"audit":0,"blockchain":0,"bounty":0,"client":0,"community":0,"compiler":0,"consensus":0,"contract":0,"decentralized":0,"deployment":0,"documentation":0,"event":0,"gas":0,"governance":0,"hash":0,"network":0,"payment":0,"protocol":0,"signature":0,"solidity":0,"testing":0,"token":0,"transaction":0,"verification":0,"wallet":0},"projects":{"Augur":0,"Bamboo":0,"Casper":0,"Embark":0,"Ethereum":0,"Geth":0,"Gitcoin":0,"Infura":0,"MetaMask":0,"Mythril":0,"Parity":0,"Plasma":0,"Remix":0,"Sharding":0,"State

Because you don\u2019t have external inputs, you\u2019re not reading from inputs, no keyboard. The path is completely deterministic. Scrubbing backwards is quite simple, rewind is entirely possible. That kind of tooling could work.\nBack in the day, there was Mix. Was a sort of debugger, but their own IDE really. But how much maintenance was this? But this is where Remix came in.

that already has what you want and you call functions on this blockchain. This is pragmatic from the gas standpoint but raises security questions on the dependency.\nSo far still statically including everything, would like to do more including things dynamically. But not comfortable with existing solutions.\nBut stuff we include statically we have to audit ourselves.\nHaven\u2019t deployed anything on Mainnet for The Graph, but are talking to firms that specialize in auditing. Want to do a full rigorous auditing.\nDo a little bit of social proof, use things widely used by the community.\nFor dependencies, still just in development so have been pretty loose with it. Have been using OpenZeppelin, widely used 3rd party libraries.","bounties":"We need to ask, what are the barriers to dapps going to mainstream? Scalability, and how to make transactions fast and cheaper.\nUseability around things like wallets, like Metamask, is also a problem. As people have to approve things, it\u2019s not a good UX. Not designed for microtransactions or to handle cases where a bunch of transactions only go to 5 dollars worth of ETH. This would be tooling. Plugins that would support payment channels (like Next) and state channels with the recent L4 paper. This needs to be integrated into the UI\/UX. Set the budget, authenticate in an easy way (finger print), and in a secure way to have it do a payment channel and eventually state channels.\nLastPass or OnePass, weird to me that they haven\u2019t moved into this space yet. Status could solve this on mobile. 99% of mainstream people won\u2019t use Metamask.\nFor Open Source Block Explorer, the big problem is around collaboration. Problem is how to solve the problem around the nodes and to incentivize this.","who_what":"Yaniv and Brandon from The Graph, query protocol for getting data off blockchains and storage networks\nFocused on research and protocol design\nThe issue is that Ethereum nodes do not maintain a lot of indexes, if you\u2019re using the JSON RPC you can\u2019t run queries on smart contract state. A lot of time, people need to transform the data. The way they\u2019re storing data onchain is not how to they want to pull that data out\nThe Graph is a Layer 2 protocol that sits on top of Ethereum that builds those indexes that makes all that data available via GraphQL.\nGraphQL has become really popular in the web and mobile community, substantial improvement over REST API\u2019s. Gives you flexibility so you can make changes to UI so you don\u2019t have to make changes to the back-end. Having this query language on Ethereum is great.\nGraphQL is a natural fit for blockchain. If you don\u2019t have a centralized infrastructure in the mix, GraphQL can make a lot of sense for this.","tooling":"Been using Truffle for Solidity. Remix on occasion. Etherscan on occasion. Looking at already polished contracts.\nUse Parity and Geth, use Parity a lot as a Rust shop.\nAll over the place with IDE, Atom, Visual Studio Code. Atom not good for writing a lot of Solidity code, only one guy is maintaining the linter for Solidity for Atom.\nHaven\u2019t been doing so much dapp development recently. Are looking into ZeppelinOS contracts, started using Aragon for contract codes.\nStruggled with Aragon at ETHBA hackathon, they made a lot of changes before the Hackathon that threw them off a lot. Overall like APM, spins up IPFS node, like the upgradeability.\nAPM (Aragon Package Manager) is not just for Aragon contracts, is statically linked to contracts on the blockchain.","frustrations":"Artificial limitations in Solidity, number of parameters in a function call, or variable length for things that you are returning. In 2018, really? I think this is the Solidity Compiler, don\u2019t think this is the limitation in the EVM. The stack limit is the other thing, you can\u2019t write good code that is abstracted well, you have to write stuff around the compiler.\nGetting data out of blockchain is hard. Our project is trying to solve this for the community.\nFor Ethereum, lots of parts of the engine are getting swapped out. Move to Vyper, will this be the preferred language? Area has a lot of churn. With move to eWasm, will there be a move away from EVM? Need clear guidance on how things are going to be upgraded. For eWasm, have a development environment for this so people can experiment on this. Giving people a way to experiment and to run on things.\nSolidity events are just sugar on top of low-level logging capabilities that EVM provides. Solidity events are just a convention that is built on top, but unclear how this breaks abstractions on top of the EVM that isn\u2019t part of the EVM itself. But this might not be able to be represented across different languages as they move to them. How much will break when people move off Solidity?","testing":"Write a lot of tests, try to make them as comprehensive as we can.\nThink we use Truffle for writing the tests, all in JavaScript. Home rolled their own utilities. Don\u2019t have anything for test coverage.\nFor end-to-end testing, would be nice for good tooling for this. Kind of pain in the ass to test other systems that interact with the blockchain.","missing_tools":"Pretty common for people to develop contracts locally but don\u2019t really know what gas costs are, and then they deploy to testnet and Mainnet and are surprised. Compile time tool for estimating gas. Embark 3.1 has a Profiler :)\nI know people are working on different types of debuggers, that\u2019s a big one. It works well in Remix, but if someone integrated this in Atom that would be pretty great.","domain_questions":"How have you found working on Aragon, esp. APM?\nOverall, I like the direction of APM, with a registry that also spins up the IPFS node with artifacts auto-deployed on it.\nThe devil is in the details and it can be quite complex, but it\u2019s a promising direction.","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"Plasma stuff. Obviously early days, but we want to see Plasma stuff ship.\nState channel stuff is still interesting. Obviously sharding and eWasm. All scaling stuff.\nWe like Vyper, which is a more functional, formally proven language.","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"","best_resources":"CryptoZombies, used to send people to Zasterin which had some good courses.

Someone just needs to copy-paste and build it: https:\/\/medium.com\/@simondlr\/lets-summon-an-autonomous-artist-a-bot-that-creates-owns-and-sells-its-own-art-ada1afad086a\nA lot of curation market stuff: usage, governance and management of the community.\nThere are different interesting ideas around this. Dmitry from Ocean proposed a model where a bounty is funded collectively, then it graduates to an NFT after a certain threshold. Will go back to him for more details on this.\nThe usage of curved bonding for network effects on bounties: let\u2019s say Status wants to issue a bounty. The buy Status bounty tokens on a curved bond, backed by SNT or Eth. This is valuable because, over time, if Status only uses Status bounty tokens for their bounties, you slowly build up a network effect around that token. Can either sell out or hold the tokens if you believe more people will fund more bounties in the futures. This allows people to speculate on the work being done in Status - it is a really a super-powered donation though.\nIt\u2019s kind of like network effects for investment or VC.","who_what":"I have been in blockchain since 2013 working in BTC. I have always looked at this stuff as a tool to enable creators, so I built an app that let people sell digital goods for BTC.\nStarted building on Ethereum when it was announced in 2014, and then more actively late 2014, working in the stack.\nCurrently most time on: Ujo music - decentralized licensing platform for musicians.\n30% of time on Curation Markets - monetize new networks of value and coordinate toward shared goals.","tooling":"I am the smart contract lead at Ujo, so spend most of my time writing Solidity and tests.\nWriting tests in Truffle and to deploy contracts.\nGenerates helpful build file with info about deployment that can then be ported into any frontend app through a simple JSON file that can have multiple networks and contracts specified in it.\nSometimes use Remix, mainly for catching syntax errors more quickly (than Atom at least, my other IDE). Works well for quick interaction (using MetaMask) with smart contracts.\nJust truffle\u2019s contract libraries to interact with frontend\nUse Oraclize for on-chain price oracle for Ujo stores.\nStrings library built by Nick Johnson that helps us parse strings in the registry more easily.\nWrote our own ERC-721 implementation as well.\nAfter CK came out, there was no fully standardised implementation. The community was still iterating over the standard, OZ also wrote one. There were some stylistic changes that Consensys wanted over the OZ work, so we still needed our own implementation.\nAlso just helps with my own understanding to write this stuff myself.\nCuration market specific tools?\nTrent from Ocean Protocol is pioneering the engineering approach to analysing token systems using well known tools from his trade that I don\u2019t understand as well as he does.\nWe use a lot of different curves for curved bonding markets, and there are some curves that are more easily visualized and assessed.\nxkcd graphs makes some interesting and easy to understand stuff.","frustrations":"For me, it\u2019s always been harder to evaluate this, because I come from building on BTC, which is orders better than the dev experience there.\nIt\u2019s always been \u201cgood enough\u201d for me, even though it is improving rapidly all the time.\nIssues with Infura detailed above cost me quite a bit in failed deployments, and the only way I figured it out was by having direct access to the Infura team, which others obviously won\u2019t and that is an issue.\nHow deployments work with different gasPrices - it\u2019s not clear if you should worry about things like time outs during the process. What if you set a low price, end up waiting hours, and your internet suddenly drops? What if there is a time out on the request to an API somewhere that fails?\nI always default to a higher gasPrice when deploying to make sure it actually passes and is including.\nBetter documentation around best practices and common pitfalls here is definitely needed.\nGanache has visual interface to their test explorer. Sometimes you want something with a more visible understanding of what transpired with certain transactions. Like etherscan displaying internal transactions and well-known contract events, but with visuals.\nVisual analysis\/element would really help developers understand what is happening in the network.\nWhen you have multiple contracts for a DApp, you need an up-to-date document\/visual interface that shows you latest deployed contract and its methods\/interfaces.Auto-generating visual tools for SC that are meant for developer aid.\nAt Ujo, we have 4 contracts, a registry, a payment handler, badges (collectibles), oracle. Gets put into JSOn file in \/build, but this is not visible or particularly useful for anyone but me.\nTake some info out into separate document so the rest of the team can easily see where they are deployed and what they do at a higher level.","testing":"Mythril is very useful and we use it.\nWriting extensive unit tests in Truffle covers a lot of the low hanging fruit and gives you a great understanding of your contracts and how they really work.\nIt really depends on the use case: i.e. checking for over- or underflow means you sometimes need to be really careful.\nBest resources to learn about tests?\nThe EVM is notoriously bad at providing good error reports.\nRevert with reason will be really helpful for this. But there might still be edge cases where it is not certain what transpired.\nYou used to require a lot of context in order to sense what\nA lot of my knowledge comes from debugging myself and following the traces through the EVM. Sometimes you just have to vasbyt (an Afrikaans word meaning, roughly, grit your teeth and just hold on).\nSolidity is moving more towards safer defaults in general, which allows more advanced devs to take the guard rails off when we know what we are doing:\nExplicitly setting the constructor (to avoid some of the Parity hacks)\nAddition of transfer function to automatically check for failure of sends (which was previously manual).\nAfter DAO hack, I started collecting information and Smart Contract best practices repo, which is now maintained by the Consensys Diligence team.\nInfura uses a load balancer between multiple Eth clients, but these have different tx pools, so during the migration process, it is pinging infura, but it is shuffling the request to different node each time, which eventually cause the migration to fail.\nHowever, the error reporting from the client claims that the nonce is too low, which is technically true, but not at all descriptive about why the migration actually failed.","missing_tools":"One thing that comes to mind is a mature, incentivized storage platform does not really exist, still. Swarm has never really answered my immediate needs, and I worry sometimes that it is a bit too similar to something like S3.\nWouldn\u2019t need to solve all problems immediately, just needs to be better than what we have today. Infura provides access to the IPFS network, and then backs them up themselves so that they have guaranteed access to it. Which is good enough, for now.\nIn the future, if you\u2019re going to have 1000\u2019s of GB of media, this will need to be looked at much more closely.\nProtocols labs multi-hashing scheme is very useful in addressing the content.","domain_questions":"What are the biggest challenges for Ethereum right now?\nIt\u2019s still uncertain to me how the development experience will change when scalability improvements start to get deployed.\nWhether it is sharding, plasma, side channels etc, what changes from a development perspective?\nHow do we choose which shard to inject our contracts into? How does the network load balance this?\nWhat does a dev need to change for Plasma, and what does it mean for UX? Does it need a separate MetaMask, or do we need to build our own in-browser wallets again?","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"Curation markets!\nMore collectible stuff. The art scene is finally catching on, which is great.

There is a storm of discussion; emotional, backhanded.\nBlackballed for mentioning cultural\/political taboos\nPR is not the right word for it.

You get it to review, 2 week review period, it\u2019s posted on top of Apple Swift website + goes out to mailing list.\nThe key point is: the 2 week speed pump. Everyone has to pass through that.\nHow DARPA handles bounties\nHere\u2019s a very specific problem and you need a 100x improvement\nCome up with working solution that can support network of 10k\nIf you can do it elegantly, here\u2019s 50k and we\u2019ll study it further before implementing\nThe community expects full-time people; they don\u2019t cater to part-time contributors.\nA contributor needs to look at all issues and PRs \u2013\u2013 there\u2019s no queueing system.

for upgradeability. How to take into account the community, dev team, investors etc. We need a governance pattern that works specifically for upgradeability decisions, which tend to be more focussed than larger governance questions and might lend themselves to specific, narrow mechanisms.\nIt may be possible to modify the way the compiler maps state variable to storage, so that we can allow people to implement similar patterns to ours without all the inline assembly stuff. Might make a nice bounty - improving the compiler in general to allow new features specifically in terms of what you can do with the EVM.\nHaving a scheduler implies huge gas costs, so we need to find scheduling mechanisms that will allow the community to run transactions in a feature for you and be rewarded with tokens or Eth or whatever. (see chronologic for this kind of stuff too)\nWe are trying to see if there is anyway to use TCRs and token curation markets in order to handle on chain standard libraries and upgradeability too.

Started contributing to Zeppelin as a security researcher, because that is the major focus at the company.\nThis gave a lot of background as I really had to grasp how thing happen in the EVM. You have to be incredibly conscious and attentive about the stuff you\u2019re programming.\nAuditing well-known projects also really helped me grow my knowledge of how the whole ecosystems works and what the best practices are.\nI am now building Zeppelin OS - upgradable smart contracts, with a scheduler, and on chain standard libraries.\nIt\u2019s a huge challenge to build this on Ethereum currently, so I became a core member and we are releasing our first version today!!","tooling":"Truffle - I don\u2019t really like it, but have to use it.\nWe can improve a lot of things here and build some more things on top of it.\nTesting your contracts easily across any network and setting your own defaults through the console is not as easy as it should be.\nTruffle scripts allow you to deploy your application, but the truffle environment itself is very difficult to manage, especially if you need to modify it to fit your specific project. You can lose days trying to do that.\nWe should start thinking about providing an interface that can be consumed, extended and used by other cmd line tools, and things like zeppelin_OS.\nThe testing environment is really good, but could still provide some extra features (like better debugging and changing variable easily between tests without needing to recompile everything).\nI haven\u2019t yet found one chance to run the debugger properly - but we really need that and it really needs to be easy to use.\nWhen I try to debug my contracts on the network, I start logging events on the smart contract to see what is happening. This is really slow, it is a waste of gas and is not the way I want to handle things in the future.\nWe also use open zeppelin a lot in our own projects: i.e. DApps we build ourselves, and zeppelin_OS - an on chain version that can be used as a standard library for zeppelin OS.\nCurrently you have to deploy manually the smart contracts from our libraries that you want to use. But now, with zeppelin_OS, everyone can build a standard library that can be linked to a project that is using zeppelin_OS and everyone can use the same source code.\nSay goodbye to all those deploy-time issues ;)\nWe use many small helper libraries: e.g. to do tricky things like testing low level calls, crafted transactions where you need to specify very small things to do with the data as an array of byte or whatever. Truffle provides no friendly way to do this, so you have to start playing with buffers of bytes and hashes and all sorts of nonsense.\nEthereumjs-abi, ethereumjs-utils etc.\nWeb3 is a great library. It\u2019s very simple, though it\u2019s been a long time that they have been promising a stable 1.0 version.\nMetaMask is also really useful - makes life easier in so many ways.\nWe use both geth and parity as we have our own nodes to test things.\nRemix is really cool and it works really well. I encourage people to use it and look forward to new releases from them.\nSharing sets\/suites of contracts easily can be improved.","frustrations":"Speed of testing in Truffle is taking ~15min and it should be 1-2 at most. We need to speed that cycle up badly.\nRopsten is really slow when we need to test something in a \u201creal\u201d network. We have needed to cancel manually our own transactions and follow many rabbits down many different holes to figure out what happened. We need a better, more realistic testnet, for all our contracts.\nYou can\u2019t set breakpoints when debugging contracts, or end-to-end transactions on the network and this can cause you to lose the whole day when you miss something as simple as a flag or a param in a contract etc.\nNo easy way to log things in Solidity, which makes missing the stuff above much easier than it should be.\nThe linter tools also take too long. It should just be possible to install and run these sorts of things without needing to do any config of your own, which is not currently the case.\nSolcoverage has to be set up manually, and the docs kind of suck around this. It took us a long time to figure it all out for ourselves.\nPlain solidity console\/interpreter to test your contracts where you can play with the types, variables and scopes without needing to recompile everything.\nVolatility of the markets - really hard to convince people to join and use the currency because of this.\nLegal issues around launching companies and products are a real PITA. We need proper DAOs and soon.\nCame out of web dev industry, and it is really mature. They have a lot of methodologies for running projects and organising teams. Most people in Ethereum are very young and these sort of processes are generally a mess.\nThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on the back of the price, and this or that ICO and we need to make sure that the community supports and contributes to better, clearer, slower processes that actually achieve the desired goals rather than cutting corners to ship not-really-decentralized products.\nWe need to figure out some new processes too unique to the problems we face in crypto.","testing":"We use Travis CI.\nCoverall for coverage tests, also for solidity coverage using solcoverage as a plugin. Super useful to us.\nWrite plain mocha tests (integration and unit) and we aim for 100% coverage always.\nWhen working on DApps we usually have standard paths to test how the UI works.\nThis is another developer tool that is missing: a tool to test UIs when signing transactions.","missing_tools":"","domain_questions":"Upgradable smart contracts?\nWe\u2019ve been exploring many different approaches over the last year, all of them using proxies: i.e a contract using a delegateCall opcode to make things happen.\nBiggest problem: we had to store information about 2 different domains, 1 of them being the proxy information and the other the contract that needs to be upgraded.\nProxy information: delegates each call to implementation contract. Storage in proxy contract, logic elsewhere, so not something new (Parity also uses this pattern).\nWe don\u2019t see how upgradability works without some kind of mechanism for governance: the proxy needs to ask someone\/something if the contract can\/should be upgraded. This information needs to be stored as well: the \u201cowner\u201d and the implementation details.\nThe way solidity manages storage, the contract that was going to be upgraded needed to follow the storage slots where the proxy was saving the relevant information because it is important not to overwrite them.\nWe found a final approach that manages this very elegantly: using inline assembly to store variable and bypass the way solidity performs its own checks. We are using storage slots that solidity will never be able to access, which is how we can ensure our approaches are really safe and that we can have upgradeable smart contracts that don\u2019t overwrite important information.\nWhy should we even have upgradeable though, if immutability is such a big thing?\nWe really don\u2019t think upgradeability works without governance.\nWe have storage in one place and logic in another. So the storage actually remains immutable and will never forget what is put into it. We can modify it, but that is part of the history and you can inspect those modifications easily if you like.\nWe are not leaving immutability then, just handling it in a smarter way.\nThe idea came from exploring the strategy Solidity itself uses for mapping of variables, but with some delta to make sure Solidity won\u2019t overwrite things.","hardest_part":"","excited_about":"Zeppelin OS!!\nReally excited to see a lot of projects on mainnet.\nDecentraland, Aragon and Status are the most exciting.\nInterested by Cardano: they have a really different way of writing smart contracts on a  blockchain and we can learn a lot from them. They also have a really good team, which is always a good lense for me to assess projects through.\nNeo is another interesting project. Haven\u2019t used it yet, but met them at a conference and they were really focussed and clear about what they are going to be doing over the next little while.\nCosmos is really interesting! It\u2019s really huge, but I am excited to see what happens there.\nPlasma, eWASM, state channels - all these things are going to be exciting to explore more.","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"Fran Giordano from Zeppelin - knows a lot about the EVM especially.\nAlejo Salles from Zeppelin - worked with quantum physics, neuroscience and AI. Mind-blowing.","best_resources":"People in zeppelin are the best resources I have!\nOne of the things I love most about Ethereum in general is the community, so we try to get to know as many other projects as we can and collaborate with them. This is a great way of finding quick answers to hard questions and getting an overview of the best current tools available.\nGoogle, ethereum stack exchange too. But the community is the best resource we have.","questions_to_ask":"I would love to know how people got involved and how they managed to be where they are right now: i.e. what path did they walk to get to where they are now.\nI would really like to know if we are all doing the same things to get to where we are, or if there are smarter ways to grow quickly without losing culture\/vision. Sometimes it feels like we\u2019re all alone in the jungle, struggling to survive, and it would be awesome if not everyone had to feel this way going forward.\nWould also be helpful to see how other companies are organising themselves on a day-to-day basis and how they collaborate with other teams, with remote workers

Using segregated accounts in uPort app, use proxy contracts that have been around like a year. These went through formal verification a while ago. We were confident with putting them on mainnet. Switching up in the future how we handle it.\nHad them audited by Consensys internally, possibly by the diligence group.\nGetting away from smart contracts, looking at a different identity protocol layer. If uPort was continuing in smart contracts  upgradeability via smart contracts (ZeppelinOS) would be interesting.\nDeprecating our smart contracts, but using ether-did (decentralization identity). Just need a private key and a public key, so don\u2019t need a smart contract. Etherdid registry is a smart contract, but smart contracts are not the core protocol any more.","bounties":"Education platform that is not focused on a business model. Loom is doing a fantastic job of educating people, but it\u2019s a business. A great general education source that is not leading to some business. Online university or online education center would be fantastic.\nBetter UI\/UX, thinking about this next layer. Get product people, designers, etc. involved. A Material design for dApps.","who_what":"I am working on uPort as a community a manager. The primary role is basically discovering how to empower developers to use uPort. uPort is a decentralized identity system.\n Getting developers to understand how to implement this in the front-end environment, get people that are not used to Ethereum to understand this\nAsk the right questions to get people thinking about this","tooling":"Eth.js, we use Nick Dodson\u2019s stuff. Inject web3js, but use more of the lightweight stuff for internal requirements. We use Truffle for tests. For the Buidlbox project, we use React-Redux. Mobile app is all react-native. Use React\/redux everywhere, React sagas.\nUse IPFS, use Infura. New spec puts us on IPFS, before we were just on Ethereum but this cost too much. Introduced IPFS to help with this, but it\u2019s a bottleneck point.","frustrations":"Personally, I don\u2019t have that many frustrations. However, Solidity has a lot of updates every time and has a lot of breaking changes. It\u2019s difficult to manage this. EthPM will help this.\nAs a team, working distributed on a lot of systems that are new is pretty tough. But have a pretty knowledgeable team.\nStill deal a lot with the JavaScript ecosystem. Heard web3js was garbage, not having promises and heard it wasn\u2019t great. Heard Ethers.js was good, supported by Richard Moore of the Ethereum Foundation. Would be great to have education that there are other options out there beyond the most popular projects\nEth.js from Nick Dodson is super bare bones and super modular, Ethers.js is a bit more built out by Richard Moore.\nI dibble dabble in smart contracts, I do a few demos with things like token staking for events. But I am mainly in the web 2 stuff. Not necessarily building out infrastructure or production ready contracts, more of showing the general web3 flow.\nWould recommend to redo Remix, want to share code from Remix. From Remix, be able to push GitHub. More of a collaborative Remix, better UI.","testing":"We run a lot of unit tests on the JavaScript, but don\u2019t do enough testing right now. For smart contracts, reach out internally at Consensys. But not baked out process. Could use a better audit process.\nCould use a better audit tool. Can test smart contracts at a code level, formal verification but haven\u2019t researched this.","missing_tools":"Drag and drop website builder for dApps, I\u2019m working on this. Product people are not able to prototype the user experience is very detrimental to the long term growth of the ecosystem\nNeed tools that enable quick validation in the real world. Need better prototyping\nDesign systems, design patterns, how to handle long transaction times. New thinking in this regard.","domain_questions":"","hardest_part":"Wrapping the head around everything in the ecosystem. Because Consensys is such a big force it\u2019s easy to focus only on Consensys spokes, but there are a lot of other solutions out there. Yesterday someone posted an alternative to Truffle but hadn\u2019t seen that before. Having a clear understanding of people in the ecosystem.\nA library of all smart contracts, background of these smart contracts along with user stories. A better understanding of existing tools. Search and get 5 different options for events smart contracts, or a decentralized exchange. See instantly these.","excited_about":"The overwhelming amount of events. ETHGlobal is doing a great job with hackathons worldwide, short term and long term benefit. More and more outreach and pulling more and more people in.","easier_expected":"","people_talk_to":"Linnia, they are doing market dataplaces for your data. Figuring out how they can build this out in Ethereum.","best_resources":"Loom\u2019s CryptoZombies and their general onboarding process, this is very approachable with good design and good practices. They\u2019ve taken a big focus on not just focusing on the code but focusing on the experience. Not good to throw encyclopedias at people. Truffle sits in the middle, they have good docs. Ethereum itself is pretty difficult to parse their docs.\nDesigning for intermediate JavaScript developers could be very interesting. Catering this education experience better.\nJust looked at smart contracts long enough, wasn\u2019t super intimidating as they are designed to be simple. Looking at Zeppelin, looking at best practices, understanding this stuff. But now want to get more into bytecode stuff.\nLack lower level knowledge of how to super optimize a smart contract. Want more code to look at to get at optimizing bytecode.\nuPort will be focusing on education, more videos to help these intermediate
